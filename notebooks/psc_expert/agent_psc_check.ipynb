      "The human biliary system, a mucosal barrier tissue connecting the liver and  intestine, is an organ often affected by serious inflammatory and malignant  diseases. Although these diseases are linked to immunological processes, the  biliary system represents an unexplored immunological niche. By combining  endoscopy-guided sampling of the biliary tree with a high-dimensional analysis  approach, comprehensive mapping of the human biliary immunological landscape in  patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a severe biliary  inflammatory disease, was conducted. Major differences in immune cell  composition in bile ducts compared to blood were revealed. Furthermore, biliary  inflammation in patients with PSC was characterized by high presence of  neutrophils and T cells as compared to control individuals without PSC. The  biliary T cells displayed a CD103+CD69+ effector memory phenotype, a combined  gut and liver homing profile, and produced interleukin-17 (IL-17) and IL-22.  Biliary neutrophil infiltration in PSC associated with CXCL8, possibly produced  by resident T cells, and CXCL16 was linked to the enrichment of T cells. This  study uncovers the immunological niche of human bile ducts, defines a local  immune network between neutrophils and biliary-resident T cells in PSC, and  provides a resource for future studies of the immune responses in biliary  disorders.\n",
