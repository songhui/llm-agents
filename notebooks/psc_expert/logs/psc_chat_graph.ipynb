      " Title: CXCR3 internalization following T cell-endothelial cell contact: preferential role of IFN-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (CXCL11). \n",
      "Abstract: Chemokine receptors are rapidly desensitized and internalized following ligand binding, a process that attenuates receptor-mediated responses. However, the physiological settings in which this process occurs are not clear. Therefore, we examined the fate of CXCR3, a chemokine receptor preferentially expressed on activated T cells following contact with endothelial cells. By immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, we found that CXCR3 was rapidly internalized when T cells were incubated with IFN-gamma-activated human saphenous vein endothelial cells (HSVEC), but not with resting HSVEC. Similar results were obtained using human CXCR3-transfected murine 300-19 B cells. CXCR3 down-regulation was significantly more pronounced when T cells were in contact with HSVEC than with their supernatants, suggesting that CXCR3 ligands were efficiently displayed on the surface of HSVEC. Using neutralizing mAbs to IFN-induced protein-10 (CXCL10), monokine induced by IFN-gamma (CXCL9), and IFN-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC; CXCL11), we found that even though I-TAC was secreted from IFN-gamma-activated HSVEC to lower levels than IFN-induced protein-10 or the monokine induced by IFN-gamma, it was the principal chemokine responsible for CXCR3 internalization. This correlated with studies using recombinant chemokines, which revealed that I-TAC was the most potent inducer of CXCR3 down-regulation and of transendothelial migration. Known inhibitors of chemokine-induced chemotaxis, such as pertussis toxin or wortmannin, did not reduce ligand-induced internalization, suggesting that a distinct signal transduction pathway mediates internalization. Our data demonstrate that I-TAC is the physiological inducer of CXCR3 internalization and suggest that chemokine receptor internalization occurs in physiological settings, such as leukocyte contact with an activated endothelium.\n",

      " Title: The CC chemokine MCP-1 stimulates surface expression of CX3CR1 and enhances the adhesion of monocytes to fractalkine/CX3CL1 via p38 MAPK. \n",
      "Abstract: The membrane-anchored form of CX3CL1 has been proposed as a novel adhesion protein for leukocytes. This functional property of CX3CL1 is mediated through CX3CR1, a chemokine receptor expressed predominantly on circulating white blood cells. Thus far, it is still uncertain at what stage of the trafficking process CX3CR1 becomes importantly involved and how the CX3CR1-dependent adhesion of leukocytes is regulated during inflammation. The objective of this study was to examine the functional effects of chemokine stimulation on CX3CR1-mediated adhesion of human monocytes. Consistent with previous reports, our data indicate that the activity of CX3CR1 on resting monocytes is sufficient to mediate cell adhesion to CX3CL1. However, the basal, nonstimulated adhesion activity is low, and we hypothesized that like the integrins, CX3CR1 may require a preceding activation step to trigger firm leukocyte adhesion. Compatible with this hypothesis, stimulation of monocytes with MCP-1 significantly increased their adhesion to immobilized CX3CL1, under both static and physiological flow conditions. The increase of the adhesion activity was mediated through CCR2-dependent signaling and obligatory activation of the p38 MAPK pathway. Stimulation with MCP-1 also induced a rapid increase of CX3CR1 protein on the cell surface. Inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway prevented this increase of CX3CR1 surface expression and blunted the effect of MCP-1 on cell adhesion, indicating a causal link between receptor surface density and adhesion activity. Together, our data suggest that a chemokine signal is required for firm CX3CR1-dependent adhesion and demonstrate that CCR2 is an important regulator of CX3CL1-dependent leukocyte adhesion.\n",

      " Title: Soluble fractalkine prevents monocyte chemoattractant protein-1-induced monocyte migration via inhibition of stress-activated protein kinase 2/p38 and matrix metalloproteinase activities. \n",
      "Abstract: In this study, we address the question of the cross-talk between two chemokines that are cosecreted during inflammation, namely monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and soluble fractalkine (s-FKN), toward monocyte migration. We found that s-FKN fails to induce MonoMac6 cell migration per se. Interestingly, this chemokine antagonizes transendothelial migration and chemotaxis of MonoMac6 cells and freshly isolated human monocytes induced by MCP-1, indicating a direct effect of s-FKN on monocytic cells. In this study, we found that stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)1/c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 and SAPK2/p38 are involved in the control of MCP-1-induced MonoMac6 cell migration. We demonstrated that s-FKN abrogates the MCP-1-induced SAPK2/p38 activation as well as the upstream Pyk2 activity. Furthermore, we observed that s-FKN also inhibits the activity of a major matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), namely MMP-2. Taken collectively, our results indicate that the s-FKN antagonizes the chemoattractant effect of MCP-1 on monocytes, likely by inhibiting crucial signaling pathways, like SAPK2/p38 and MMP-2 activities.\n",

Interestingly, this chemokine antagonizes transendothelial migration and chemotaxis of MonoMac6 cells and freshly isolated human monocytes induced by MCP-1, indicating a direct effect of s-FKN on monocytic cells. In this study, we found that stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)1/c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 and SAPK2/p38 are involved in the control of MCP-1-induced MonoMac6 cell migration. We demonstrated that s-FKN abrogates the MCP-1-induced SAPK2/p38 activation as well as the upstream Pyk2 activity. Furthermore, we observed that s-FKN also inhibits the activity of a major matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), namely MMP-2. Taken collectively, our results indicate that the s-FKN antagonizes the chemoattractant effect of MCP-1 on monocytes, likely by inhibiting crucial signaling pathways, like SAPK2/p38 and MMP-2 activities.\n",

      " Title: Immunohistochemical analysis of adhesion molecules in the micro-environment of portal tracts in relation to aberrant expression of PDC-E2 and HLA-DR on the bile ducts in primary biliary cirrhosis. \n",
      "Abstract: We have examined immunohistochemically the expression of adhesion molecules in the micro-environment of portal tracts and their relationship to the expression of the pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 complex (PDC-E2) and HLA-DR in liver biopsy specimens. Ten cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and 19 controls were examined, including four cases of extrahepatic biliary obstruction, six of chronic viral hepatitis, and nine normal livers. In PBC, the damaged small bile ducts demonstrated an increased expression of PDC-E2 and an aberrant expression of HLA-DR; about half of these damaged bile ducts also expressed intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM)-1 and a few expressed vascular adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1. In addition, lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1 and very late antigen (VLA)-4 were expressed on infiltrating lymphocytes around these bile ducts. In contrast, in control livers, these alterations in antigen expression on the bile ducts were either not observed or were only focal and weak, when present. These findings suggest that ICAM-1/LFA-1 and also VCAM-1/VLA-4 linkages between the damaged bile ducts and lymphocytes may facilitate antigen-specific reactions such as the presentation of antigens, possibly PDC-E2, to the periductal lymphocytes in PBC. ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin were strongly expressed on the endothelial cells of some vessels in the portal tracts in PBC, suggesting the facilitation of the recruitment of lymphocytes around the bile ducts of PBC. VCAM-1, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, has not hitherto been reported on bile ducts.\n",

      " Title: Adhesion molecule expression in primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis. \n",
      "Abstract: There are conflicting reports regarding intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Expression of adhesion molecules ICAM-1, lymphocyte adhesion molecule-1 (LFA-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), and E-selectin was examined together with HLA-DR in 16 liver biopsy specimens showing PSC and 12 specimens showing PBC. These were compared with biopsy specimens showing large duct obstruction (n = 7), chronic active hepatitis (n = 4), alcoholic liver disease (n = 4), and normal liver histological results (n = 5). ICAM-1 was detected on biliary epithelium in five of seven PSC specimens of histological stage 3 or 4, but not in nine early PSC specimens or in specimens from disease controls. In PBC, ICAM-1 was positive on three of 12 cases, two stage 2, and one stage 3. Nine of 16 PSC specimens (three of nine early, six of seven late disease) and six of 10 PBC specimens (three early, three late disease) were positive for HLA-DR. LFA-1 stained infiltrating inflammatory cells in PSC, PBC, and disease controls. In conclusion, ICAM-1 expression on biliary epithelium in PSC occurs mainly in late stage disease and therefore may be secondary to previous events inducing inflammation rather than of primary pathogenic importance. ICAM-1 expression in PBC is less common and not clearly associated with a particular disorder. Previous reports of ICAM-1 prevalence may have been biased towards end stage, pre-transplantation biopsy specimens.\n",

ICAM-1 was detected on biliary epithelium in five of seven PSC specimens of histological stage 3 or 4, but not in nine early PSC specimens or in specimens from disease controls. In PBC, ICAM-1 was positive on three of 12 cases, two stage 2, and one stage 3. Nine of 16 PSC specimens (three of nine early, six of seven late disease) and six of 10 PBC specimens (three early, three late disease) were positive for HLA-DR. LFA-1 stained infiltrating inflammatory cells in PSC, PBC, and disease controls. In conclusion, ICAM-1 expression on biliary epithelium in PSC occurs mainly in late stage disease and therefore may be secondary to previous events inducing inflammation rather than of primary pathogenic importance. ICAM-1 expression in PBC is less common and not clearly associated with a particular disorder. Previous reports of ICAM-1 prevalence may have been biased towards end stage, pre-transplantation biopsy specimens.\n",

      "Abstract: Lymphocyte recruitment to tissue is regulated by homing molecules expressed on subsets of leukocytes that bind to endothelial adhesion molecules termed addressins in target tissues. The addressins and homing molecules involved in recruiting lymphocytes to inflamed human liver are not known. E-selectin, which acts as an addressin for a subset of skin-infiltrating T cells that express a distinct E-selectin ligand called the cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA), can be detected on endothelium in inflammatory liver diseases suggesting it might also act as an addressin for liver-infiltrating lymphocytes. To determine whether E-selectin does play such a role we looked for concomitant expression of E-selectin on hepatic endothelium and E-selectin ligands on infiltrating lymphocytes in liver sections from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), acute allograft rejection, alcoholic liver disease, and normal liver. E-selectin was detected on vascular endothelium in association with lymphocytic infiltrates in all three liver diseases but not on normal endothelium. However, less that 10% of infiltrating lymphocytes expressed the only known lymphocyte E-selectin ligand, CLA. We used E-selectin chimeric fusion proteins to probe for novel E-selectin ligands on liver-infiltrating lymphocytes; however, less than 10% of lymphocytes had t he ability to bind the fusion proteins. Thus, E-selectin is unlikely to act as an addressin for liver-infiltrating lymphocytes, suggesting that other molecules are involved in lymphocyte recruitment to the liver. Despite the lack of binding to lymphocytes other structures in the liver expressed CLA and bound the E-selectin fusion proteins. Inflamed, but not normal, intrahepatic bile ducts expressed CLA and bound E-selectin, suggesting that they express activation dependent carbohydrate binding receptors. Furthermore, Kupffer cells did not express CLA but bound to both E-selectin fusion proteins, suggesting that they express potentially novel E-selectin ligands.\n",

      "{\"query\":\"MERGE (p:Paper {doi: \\\"10.1002/hep.510240311\\\"}) SET p.title = \\\"Expression of E-selectin and E-selectin ligands in human liver inflammation.\\\", p.abstract = \\\"Lymphocyte recruitment to tissue is regulated by homing molecules expressed on subsets of leukocytes that bind to endothelial adhesion molecules termed addressins in target tissues. The addressins and homing molecules involved in recruiting lymphocytes to inflamed human liver are not known. E-selectin, which acts as an addressin for a subset of skin-infiltrating T cells that express a distinct E-selectin ligand called the cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA), can be detected on endothelium in inflammatory liver diseases suggesting it might also act as an addressin for liver-infiltrating lymphocytes. To determine whether E-selectin does play such a role we looked for concomitant expression of E-selectin on hepatic endothelium and E-selectin ligands on infiltrating lymphocytes in liver sections from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), acute allograft rejection, alcoholic liver disease, and normal liver. E-selectin was detected on vascular endothelium in association with lymphocytic infiltrates in all three liver diseases but not on normal endothelium. However, less that 10% of infiltrating lymphocytes expressed the only known lymphocyte E-selectin ligand, CLA. We used E-selectin chimeric fusion proteins to probe for novel E-selectin ligands on liver-infiltrating lymphocytes; however, less than 10% of lymphocytes had t he ability to bind the fusion proteins. Thus, E-selectin is unlikely to act as an addressin for liver-infiltrating lymphocytes, suggesting that other molecules are involved in lymphocyte recruitment to the liver. Despite the lack of binding to lymphocytes other structures in the liver expressed CLA and bound the E-selectin fusion proteins. Inflamed, but not normal, intrahepatic bile ducts expressed CLA and bound E-selectin, suggesting that they express activation dependent carbohydrate binding receptors. Furthermore, Kupffer cells did not express CLA but bound to both E-selectin fusion proteins, suggesting that they express potentially novel E-selectin ligands.\\\"\"}\n",

      "Abstract: This study examined the role of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) in the autoimmune process of bile duct destruction in the early stages of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Ten PBC liver samples and five control samples were studied. Immunohistochemical studies of ICAM-1 and LFA-1, and Western blot of ICAM-1 were performed. Immunoelectron microscopy was conducted using immunoglobulin-gold and silver staining. Human ICAM-land LFA-1 peptide nucleic acid probes were used for in situ hybridization. In PBC liver samples, immunohistochemistry showed aberrant ICAM-1 expression on bile duct epithelial plasma membrane and also luminal sites of endothelial plasma membrane of terminal portal venules. Western blot confirmed ICAM-1 protein expression. LFA-1-positive lymphocytes were associated with epithelial cells of septal and interlobular bile ducts. Immunoelectron microscopy localized ICAM-1 on the luminal and basal surfaces as well as on lymphocytes around damaged bile duct epithelial cells, and LFA-1 on lymphocytes around damaged bile ducts. Messenger RNA expression of ICAM-1 was demonstrated in bile ducts, and LFA-1 in lymphocytes around bile ducts. De novo expression of ICAM-1 and LFA-1 at protein and mRNA levels in PBC may imply an inductive role of ICAM-1 through binding with its ligand LFA-1 in the extravasation of activated lymphocytes and lymphocyte-mediated bile duct destruction.\n",

      "Abstract: Crosstalk between hepatic sinusoidal ECs and closely juxtaposed hepatocytes via vascular endothelial growth factor is essential for the maintenance of sinusoidal endothelial growth and differentiation. We propose that paracrine interactions between endothelial cells and hepatocytes also may be responsible for the unique complement of adhesion receptors expressed on sinusoidal endothelium that regulate the recruitment of lymphocytes into the liver. To address this hypothesis, we developed an in vitro model of the hepatic sinusoid in which flowing lymphocytes could interact with hepatic endothelium conditioned by the presence of hepatocytes. Human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells cocultured with hepatocytes were activated so that they supported the adhesion of lymphocytes at levels equivalent to those seen on endothelium stimulated with the inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-beta. Lymphocyte adhesion was supported by intracellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and E-selectin, with an additional contribution from the novel adhesion receptor VAP-1. In conclusion, we show that interactions between hepatocytes and endothelial cells amplify leukocyte recruitment through the sinusoids by regulating the expression and function of endothelial adhesion molecules. These paracrine interactions may be responsible for the induction of the adhesion molecules that support constitutive lymphocyte recruitment to the liver as well as contributing significantly to the patterns of leukocyte adhesion seen during episodes of hepatic inflammation.\n",

      " Title: Vascular adhesion protein-1 mediates adhesion and transmigration of lymphocytes on human hepatic endothelial cells. \n",
      "Abstract: Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is an amine oxidase and adhesion receptor that is expressed by endothelium in the human liver. The hepatic sinusoids are perfused by blood at low flow rates, and sinusoidal endothelium lacks selectin expression and has low levels of CD31, suggesting that VAP-1 may play a specific role in lymphocyte recruitment to the liver. In support of this we now report the constitutive expression of VAP-1 on human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSEC) in vitro and demonstrate that VAP-1 supports adhesion and transmigration of lymphocytes across these cells under physiological shear stress. These are the first studies to report the function of VAP-1 on primary human endothelial cells. Under static conditions lymphocyte adhesion to unstimulated HSEC was dependent on VAP-1 and ICAM-2, whereas adhesion to TNF-alpha-stimulated HSEC was dependent on ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and VAP-1. Under conditions of flow, blocking VAP-1 reduced lymphocyte adhesion to TNF-alpha-treated HSEC by 50% and significantly reduced the proportion of adherent lymphocytes that transmigrated across cytokine or LPS-activated endothelium. In addition, inhibition of the amine oxidase activity of VAP-1 reduced both adhesion and transmigration of lymphocytes to a level similar to that seen with VAP-1 Ab. Thus, VAP-1 can support transendothelial migration as well as adhesion, and both functions are dependent on its enzymatic activity. In the absence of selectins and CD31, VAP-1 may play a specific role in lymphocyte recruitment via hepatic sinusoidal endothelium. Moreover, since VAP-1 is induced on nonhepatic endothelium in response to inflammation, its ability to support lymphocyte transendothelial migration may be an important systemic function of VAP-1.\n",

      " Title: Vascular adhesion protein-1 mediates adhesion and transmigration of lymphocytes on human hepatic endothelial cells. \n",
      "Abstract: Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is an amine oxidase and adhesion receptor that is expressed by endothelium in the human liver. The hepatic sinusoids are perfused by blood at low flow rates, and sinusoidal endothelium lacks selectin expression and has low levels of CD31, suggesting that VAP-1 may play a specific role in lymphocyte recruitment to the liver. In support of this we now report the constitutive expression of VAP-1 on human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSEC) in vitro and demonstrate that VAP-1 supports adhesion and transmigration of lymphocytes across these cells under physiological shear stress. These are the first studies to report the function of VAP-1 on primary human endothelial cells. Under static conditions lymphocyte adhesion to unstimulated HSEC was dependent on VAP-1 and ICAM-2, whereas adhesion to TNF-alpha-stimulated HSEC was dependent on ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and VAP-1. Under conditions of flow, blocking VAP-1 reduced lymphocyte adhesion to TNF-alpha-treated HSEC by 50% and significantly reduced the proportion of adherent lymphocytes that transmigrated across cytokine or LPS-activated endothelium. In addition, inhibition of the amine oxidase activity of VAP-1 reduced both adhesion and transmigration of lymphocytes to a level similar to that seen with VAP-1 Ab. Thus, VAP-1 can support transendothelial migration as well as adhesion, and both functions are dependent on its enzymatic activity. In the absence of selectins and CD31, VAP-1 may play a specific role in lymphocyte recruitment via hepatic sinusoidal endothelium. Moreover, since VAP-1 is induced on nonhepatic endothelium in response to inflammation, its ability to support lymphocyte transendothelial migration may be an important systemic function of VAP-1.\n",

      "Abstract: A two-step paradigm for leukocyte recruitment has been established in a number of tissues including the mesentery, skin, and muscle, and necessitates an initial rolling step via the selectins before firm leukocyte adhesion via the integrins. In view of the many inflammatory diseases that involve the liver, we investigated the importance of rolling and the selectins in the hepatic microvasculature and compared the responses to that of the commonly used mesentery or cremaster microvasculature. We visualized the liver microvasculature using intravital microscopy and we determined that within the liver the majority of leukocytes adhere within the sinusoids (80%) in response to a chemotactic stimulus such as FMLP (20% in postsinusoidal venules) whereas leukocytes adhere exclusively within postcapillary venules in tissue like the mouse cremaster. In the sinusoids, the adhesive response to FMLP is not dependent upon selectins inasmuch as adhesion was not reduced in the sinusoidal vessels of P-selectin-deficient mice or E-selectin/P-selectin- deficient animals in the presence or absence of L-selectin antibody. No rolling or adhesion was detected in response to FMLP in the selectin-deficient cremaster microvasculature. Immunoneutralization of selectins with fucoidan in wildtype mice eliminated rolling and adhesion in the cremaster but failed to affect adhesion in the liver sinusoids in response to FMLP. More long-term leukocyte recruitment with lipopolysaccharide (4 h) was also impaired in the cremaster but not the liver microvasculature in selectin-deficient animals. Leukocyte adhesion in the sinusoids was reduced in P-selectin-deficient mice also lacking intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). This study for the first time demonstrates that selectins are not an essential step for leukocyte recruitment into the inflamed liver microvasculature.\n",

Leukocyte adhesion in the sinusoids was reduced in P-selectin-deficient mice also lacking intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). This study for the first time demonstrates that selectins are not an essential step for leukocyte recruitment into the inflamed liver microvasculature.\n",

In view of the many inflammatory diseases that involve the liver, we investigated the importance of rolling and the selectins in the hepatic microvasculature and compared the responses to that of the commonly used mesentery or cremaster microvasculature. We visualized the liver microvasculature using intravital microscopy and we determined that within the liver the majority of leukocytes adhere within the sinusoids (80%) in response to a chemotactic stimulus such as FMLP (20% in postsinusoidal venules) whereas leukocytes adhere exclusively within postcapillary venules in tissue like the mouse cremaster. In the sinusoids, the adhesive response to FMLP is not dependent upon selectins inasmuch as adhesion was not reduced in the sinusoidal vessels of P-selectin-deficient mice or E-selectin/P-selectin- deficient animals in the presence or absence of L-selectin antibody. No rolling or adhesion was detected in response to FMLP in the selectin-deficient cremaster microvasculature. Immunoneutralization of selectins with fucoidan in wildtype mice eliminated rolling and adhesion in the cremaster but failed to affect adhesion in the liver sinusoids in response to FMLP. More long-term leukocyte recruitment with lipopolysaccharide (4 h) was also impaired in the cremaster but not the liver microvasculature in selectin-deficient animals.

      "Abstract: Leukocyte extravasation from the blood into tissues is crucial for normal immune surveillance and in inflammation. Traditionally molecules belonging to selectin, chemokine, integrin, and immunoglobulin super families are thought to mediate the multiple adhesive and activation events needed for a successful emigration cascade. Recently, emerging evidence suggests that enzymes expressed on the surface of endothelial cells and leukocytes also contribute to the leukocyte extravasation cascade. Here we briefly review the role of vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) and CD73, 2 cell surface enzymes, in leukocyte migration form the blood into the tissues. Importantly, specific enzyme inhibitors, gene-deficient mice, and recombinant enzymes have recently unambiguously shown that the catalytic activity of these enzymes regulates the leukocyte traffic. The concept of enzymatic regulation of leukocyte extravasation provides new insight into the multi-step adhesion cascade and opens new possibilities for inhibiting inappropriate inflammatory reaction through the use of small molecule enzyme inhibitors.\n",

      " Title: Vascular adhesion protein 1 (VAP-1) mediates lymphocyte subtype-specific, selectin-independent recognition of vascular endothelium in human lymph nodes. \n",
      "Abstract: Interactions between lymphocyte surface receptors and their ligands on vascular endothelial cells regulate the exit of lymphocytes from the circulation. Distinct subsets of mononuclear cells bind to high endothelial venules (HEVs) in different lymphoid organs to a different extent, but the molecular mechanisms behind this selectivity have remained poorly characterized. Here we show that vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) mediates subtype-specific binding of CD8-positive T cells and natural killer cells to human endothelium. VAP-1-dependent, oligosaccharide-dependent peripheral lymph node (PLN) HEV adhesion under shear was independent of L-selectin, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1, and alpha4 integrins, the known lymphocyte receptors involved in the initial recognition of endothelial cells. PLN HEV adhesion was also critically dependent on peripheral lymph node vascular addressins (PNAds), but lymphocyte L-selectin was absolutely required for PNAd binding. Most lymphocytes relied on both PNAd and VAP-1 in HEV binding. The overlapping function of L-selectin ligands and VAP-1 in PLN introduces a new control point into the lymphocyte extravasation process. Finally, intravital microscopy revealed that VAP-1 is involved in initial interactions between human lymphocytes and endothelial cells in inflamed rabbit mesenterial venules in vivo. In conclusion, VAP-1 is a novel contact-initiating ligand that discriminates between different subpopulations of mononuclear cells and is an appealing target for selective modulation of adhesion of CD8- and CD16-positive effector cells.\n",

      " Title: Vascular adhesion protein 1 mediates binding of T cells to human hepatic endothelium. \n",
      "Abstract: Molecules that regulate T-cell adhesion to hepatic endothelium and thereby recirculation of T cells to the liver are poorly understood. Because the adhesion molecule vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1), which mediates lymphocyte binding to lymph node endothelium, is expressed on hepatic endothelium, it could play a role in regulating T-cell recruitment to the liver. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of VAP-1 expression in human liver and the ability of VAP-1 to support T-cell binding to hepatic endothelium in vitro. Hepatic VAP-1 expression was investigated using immunohistochemistry and specific monoclonal antibodies, and VAP-1-mediated adhesion to hepatic endothelium was investigated with a tissue-binding adhesion assay using human liver sections. VAP-1 was expressed on sinusoidal and vascular endothelium in non-inflamed liver and in inflamed liver from patients with either allograft rejection or primary biliary cirrhosis. T cells from healthy donors bound to hepatic endothelium when added to noninflamed liver sections; this binding was inhibited by a specific anti-VAP-1 antibody but not by antibodies to intercellular adhesion molecule 1, lymphocyte function--associated antigen 1, or very late after activation (antigen) 4. VAP-1--mediated adhesion was unaffected by T-cell activation with phorbol ester. VAP-1 is constitutively expressed on hepatic endothelium and mediates T-cell adhesion to hepatic endothelium in vitro. VAP-1 could play a critical role in regulating T-cell recirculation to the liver in vivo.\n",

The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of VAP-1 expression in human liver and the ability of VAP-1 to support T-cell binding to hepatic endothelium in vitro. Hepatic VAP-1 expression was investigated using immunohistochemistry and specific monoclonal antibodies, and VAP-1-mediated adhesion to hepatic endothelium was investigated with a tissue-binding adhesion assay using human liver sections. VAP-1 was expressed on sinusoidal and vascular endothelium in non-inflamed liver and in inflamed liver from patients with either allograft rejection or primary biliary cirrhosis. T cells from healthy donors bound to hepatic endothelium when added to noninflamed liver sections; this binding was inhibited by a specific anti-VAP-1 antibody but not by antibodies to intercellular adhesion molecule 1, lymphocyte function--associated antigen 1, or very late after activation (antigen) 4. VAP-1--mediated adhesion was unaffected by T-cell activation with phorbol ester. VAP-1 is constitutively expressed on hepatic endothelium and mediates T-cell adhesion to hepatic endothelium in vitro. VAP-1 could play a critical role in regulating T-cell recirculation to the liver in vivo.\n",

Vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VAP-1) is a surface-expressed endothelial glycoprotein, which belongs to a distinct subgroup of monoamine oxidases. We show here that catalytic activity of VAP-1 on primary endothelial cells directly regulates lymphocyte rolling under defined laminar shear. VAP-1 seems to bind to a primary amino group presented on the lymphocyte surface and oxidatively deaminate it in a reaction, which results in the formation of a transient covalent bond between the two cell types. Instead, soluble reaction products (aldehydes and hydrogen peroxide) are not needed for the VAP-1-dependent rolling.

      " Title: The oxidase activity of vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) induces endothelial E- and P-selectins and leukocyte binding. \n",
      "Abstract: Leukocyte migration from the blood into tissues is pivotal in immune homeostasis and in inflammation. During the multistep extravasation cascade, endothelial selectins (P- and E-selectin) and vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1), a cell-surface-expressed oxidase, are important in tethering and rolling. Here, we studied the signaling functions of the catalytic activity of VAP-1. Using human endothelial cells transfected with wild-type VAP-1 and an enzymatically inactive VAP-1 point mutant, we show that transcription and translation of E- and P-selectins are induced through the enzymatic activity of VAP-1. Moreover, use of VAP-1-deficient animals and VAP-1-deficient animals carrying the human VAP-1 as a transgene show a VAP-enzyme activity-dependent induction of P-selectin in vivo. Up-regulation of P-selectin was found both in high endothelial venules in lymphoid tissues and in flat-walled vessels in noninflamed tissues. VAP-1 activity in vivo led to increased P-selectin-dependent binding of lymphocytes to endothelial cells. These data show that the oxidase reaction catalyzed by VAP-1 alters the expression of other molecules involved in the leukocyte extravasation cascade. Our findings indicate cross-talk between adhesion molecules involved in the tethering and rolling of leukocytes and show that VAP-1-dependent signaling can prime the vessels for an enhanced inflammatory response.\n",

Our findings indicate cross-talk between adhesion molecules involved in the tethering and rolling of leukocytes and show that VAP-1-dependent signaling can prime the vessels for an enhanced inflammatory response.\n",

      "Abstract: Leukocyte migration from the blood into tissues is pivotal in immune homeostasis and in inflammation. During the multistep extravasation cascade, endothelial selectins (P- and E-selectin) and vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1), a cell-surface-expressed oxidase, are important in tethering and rolling. Here, we studied the signaling functions of the catalytic activity of VAP-1. Using human endothelial cells transfected with wild-type VAP-1 and an enzymatically inactive VAP-1 point mutant, we show that transcription and translation of E- and P-selectins are induced through the enzymatic activity of VAP-1. Moreover, use of VAP-1-deficient animals and VAP-1-deficient animals carrying the human VAP-1 as a transgene show a VAP-enzyme activity-dependent induction of P-selectin in vivo. Up-regulation of P-selectin was found both in high endothelial venules in lymphoid tissues and in flat-walled vessels in noninflamed tissues. VAP-1 activity in vivo led to increased P-selectin-dependent binding of lymphocytes to endothelial cells. These data show that the oxidase reaction catalyzed by VAP-1 alters the expression of other molecules involved in the leukocyte extravasation cascade. Our findings indicate cross-talk between adhesion molecules involved in the tethering and rolling of leukocytes and show that VAP-1-dependent signaling can prime the vessels for an enhanced inflammatory response.\n",

      " Title: Activation of vascular adhesion protein-1 on liver endothelium results in an NF-kappaB-dependent increase in lymphocyte adhesion. \n",
      "Abstract: Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is an adhesion molecule and amine oxidase that is expressed at high levels in the human liver. It promotes leukocyte adhesion to the liver in vivo and drives lymphocyte transmigration across hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells in vitro. We report that in addition to supporting leukocyte adhesion, provision of specific substrate to VAP-1 results in hepatic endothelial cell activation, which can be abrogated by treatment with the enzyme inhibitor semicarbazide. VAP-1-mediated activation was rapid; dependent upon nuclear factor-kappaB, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways; and led to upregulation of the adhesion molecules E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and secretion of the chemokine CXCL8. This response resulted in enhanced lymphocyte adhesion, was restricted to hepatic endothelial cells that expressed VAP-1, and was not observed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. We propose that as well as directly promoting adhesion via interactions with the as yet unknown ligand, binding of enzyme substrate to VAP-1 can indirectly promote inflammatory cell recruitment via upregulation of adhesion molecules and chemokines. This response is likely to be important for the recruitment of leukocytes to the liver and suggests that VAP-1 inhibitors have therapeutic potential for treating chronic inflammatory liver disease.\n",

      " Title: Induction and function of vascular adhesion protein-1 at sites of inflammation. \n",
      "Abstract: Emigration of leukocytes from the blood into the tissues is critical in controlling lymphocyte patrolling in different lymphatic organs and in leukocyte accumulation at sites of inflammation. During the first stage of the extravasation process, leukocytes bind to the endothelial lining of vessels. At the molecular level, several adhesion molecules on leukocytes and endothelial cells function as receptor-ligand pairs in mediating this dynamic interaction. Recently, we have identified a novel human endothelial cell molecule, vascular adhesion protein 1 (VAP-1), that mediates lymphocyte binding (Salmi, M., and S. Jalkanen. 1992. Science [Wash. DC] 257:1407). VAP-1 was initially characterized by mAb 1B2 which inhibits lymphocyte adhesion to high endothelial venules (HEV) and to purified VAP-1 protein. Here we report the location and function of VAP-1 in normal and inflamed tissues in humans. VAP-1 is abundant in HEV of lymphatic organs belonging to the peripheral lymph node system, but considerably less is expressed in vessels of mucosa-associated lymphatic tissues. A subset of venules in most normal nonlymphatic tissues like skin, brain, kidney, liver, and heart is also VAP-1 positive. In addition to vessels, VAP-1 is distributed on a few other cell types, most notably in dendritic-like cells of germinal centers. At sites of inflammation, such as in inflammatory bowel diseases and chronic dermatoses, expression of VAP-1 is clearly increased. The induced VAP-1 is functional, since mAb 1B2 inhibits lymphocyte binding to inflamed lamina propria venules by approximately 60%. Thus VAP-1 is an endothelial adhesion molecule that under normal conditions is expressed mainly in HEV of lymphatic tissues. However, expression of functional VAP-1 in vivo is upregulated during an inflammatory reaction at other sites as well. Inducibility of VAP-1 suggests that it may play a significant role, not only in recirculation of lymphocytes, but also in controlling entry of leukocytes into sites of inflammation.\n",

      " Title: Organ-selective regulation of vascular adhesion protein-1 expression in man. \n",
      "Abstract: Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is an endothelial molecule which mediates lymphocyte binding to endothelium in peripheral lymph nodes and at certain sites of inflammation. The expression of VAP-1 in vivo is strongly up-regulated in inflamed tissues, such as gut and skin. The purpose of this work was to examine the factors responsible for this induction of VAP-1. Since the expression of VAP-1 could not be induced in cultured endothelial cells with a large panel of mediators, we used an organ culture technique for the investigation of the regulation of VAP-1 expression in a more physiological micromilieu. Indeed, we found that the expression of endothelial VAP-1 could be up-regulated in human tonsillar tissue with interleukin (IL)-1, IL-4, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), interferon (IFN)-gamma and lipopolysaccharide, whereas histamine, thrombin, dibutyryl cAMP, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) had no effect. The induced VAP-1 protein was similar in molecular weight to the non-induced VAP-1, suggesting that VAP-1 synthesized de novo carries appropriate carbohydrate moieties. In contrast to tonsil organ culture, similar inductions performed with human appendix showed no up-regulation of VAP-1 expression, indicating that the regulation of VAP-1 expression exhibits organ-selective characteristics. Furthermore, in these tissues the smooth muscle cells, which constitutively express VAP-1, could not be stimulated to alter their level of expression of this molecule. In conclusion, the expression of VAP-1 can be markedly up-regulated with several mediators in tonsil but not in appendix organ culture, whereas cultured endothelial cells cannot be induced to express VAP-1. These results indicate that the expression of VAP-1 is regulated in a tissue- and cell type-selective manner, and a correct micromilieu is required for the up-regulation to occur.\n",

      " Title: Human vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) plays a critical role in lymphocyte-endothelial cell adhesion cascade under shear. \n",
      "Abstract: Lymphocyte binding to vascular endothelium is a prerequisite for the movement of immune cells from the blood into lymphoid tissues and into sites of inflammation. Human vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is an endothelial glycoprotein involved in this interaction. It also displays an enzymatic (monoamine oxidase) activity. Here we examined how recombinant human VAP-1 mediates lymphocyte binding using rotatory and flow chamber binding assays. VAP-1 cDNA transfected into an endothelial cell line, which does not bind lymphocytes, renders the cell line capable of binding lymphocytes in a shear-dependent manner. VAP-1 transfectants bound lymphocytes 5 times better than monocytes with a preference for T killer cells, and no specific granulocyte adherence was detectable. The binding is partially inhibited by anti-VAP-1 monoclonal antibodies or by blocking lymphocyte L-selectin and CD18 integrins, but not by inhibition of several other homing-associated molecules. In contrast, CD44 ligation on lymphocytes markedly upregulates their VAP-1-dependent adhesion, suggesting that the VAP-1 counterreceptor can be activated via CD44. The transfectant model also allowed us to perform detailed structure-function analyses of VAP-1. We show that the exposed integrin-binding motif RGD or the enzymatic activity is not indispensable for VAP-1-dependent adhesion. Together, these data show that VAP-1 can reconstitute the lymphocyte-endothelial adhesion cascade under shear and propose a critical role for VAP-1 in lymphocyte emigration from the blood.\n",

The transfectant model also allowed us to perform detailed structure-function analyses of VAP-1. We show that the exposed integrin-binding motif RGD or the enzymatic activity is not indispensable for VAP-1-dependent adhesion. Together, these data show that VAP-1 can reconstitute the lymphocyte-endothelial adhesion cascade under shear and propose a critical role for VAP-1 in lymphocyte emigration from the blood.\n",

      "Abstract: Lymphocyte binding to vascular endothelium is a prerequisite for the movement of immune cells from the blood into lymphoid tissues and into sites of inflammation. Human vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is an endothelial glycoprotein involved in this interaction. It also displays an enzymatic (monoamine oxidase) activity. Here we examined how recombinant human VAP-1 mediates lymphocyte binding using rotatory and flow chamber binding assays. VAP-1 cDNA transfected into an endothelial cell line, which does not bind lymphocytes, renders the cell line capable of binding lymphocytes in a shear-dependent manner. VAP-1 transfectants bound lymphocytes 5 times better than monocytes with a preference for T killer cells, and no specific granulocyte adherence was detectable. The binding is partially inhibited by anti-VAP-1 monoclonal antibodies or by blocking lymphocyte L-selectin and CD18 integrins, but not by inhibition of several other homing-associated molecules. In contrast, CD44 ligation on lymphocytes markedly upregulates their VAP-1-dependent adhesion, suggesting that the VAP-1 counterreceptor can be activated via CD44.

      "Abstract: The mechanisms that mediate the recruitment of Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes in vivo are poorly understood. We demonstrate that the mechanisms by which exogenously produced CD4(+) Th1 and Th2 cells roll and adhere in Con A-inflamed liver microcirculation differ dramatically: Th1 cells use alpha(4)beta(1)-integrin and Th2 cells use the vascular adhesion protein (VAP)-1. P-selectin plays no detectable role in Th1 or Th2 cell trafficking in liver microcirculation. Cellular recruitment in the liver sinusoids has previously been shown to be independent of many known adhesion molecules, leading to the suggestion that recruitment in these structures is mediated by physical trapping.

      " Title: The relative activity of CXCR3 and CCR5 ligands in T lymphocyte migration: concordant and disparate activities in vitro and in vivo. \n",
      "Abstract: In chronic inflammatory reactions such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, T cells in the inflamed tissue express the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR5, and the chemokine ligands (CCL) of these receptors are present in the inflammatory lesions. However, the contribution of these chemokines to T cell recruitment to sites of inflammation is unclear. In addition, the relative roles of the chemokines that bind CXCR3 (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11) and CCR5 (CCL3, CCL4, CCL5) in this process are unknown. The in vitro chemotaxis and in vivo migration of antigen-activated T lymphoblasts and unactivated spleen T cells to chemokines were examined. T lymphoblasts migrated in vitro to CXCR3 ligands with a relative potency of CXCL10 > CXCL11 > CXCL9, but these cells demonstrated much less chemotaxis to the CCR5 ligands. In vivo, T lymphocytes were recruited in large numbers with rapid kinetics to skin sites injected with CXCL10 and CCL5 and less to CCL3, CCL4, CXCL9, and CXCL11. The combination of CCL5 with CXCL10 but not the other chemokines markedly increased recruitment. Coinjection of interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-1alpha to up-regulate endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression with CXCL10 or CCL5 induced an additive increase in lymphoblast migration. Thus, CXCR3 ligands are more chemotactic than CCR5 ligands in vitro; however, in vivo, CXCL10 and CCL5 have comparable T cell-recruiting activities to cutaneous sites and are more potent than the other CXCR3 and CCR5 chemokines. Therefore, in vitro chemotaxis induced by these chemokines is not necessarily predictive of their in vivo lymphocyte-recruiting activity.\n",

      "Abstract: The preferential association of some chemokine receptors with human Th1 or Th2 cells has recently been reported. In this study, the expression of CCR3, CCR5, CXCR3, and CXCR4 were analyzed by flow cytometry in three distinct in vitro models of Th1/Th2 polarization, activated naive and memory T cells, and T-cell clones, in which the intracellular synthesis of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) and the surface expression of CD30 and LAG-3 were also assessed. Moreover, by using immunohistochemistry the in vivo expression of CCR3, CCR5, CXCR3, and CXCR4 was examined in the gut of patients suffering from Crohn s disease, a Th1-dominated disorder, and in the skin of patients suffering from systemic sclerosis, a Th2-dominated disorder. CCR5 and LAG-3 exhibited the same pathway of Th1 association, whereas CXCR3 did not discriminate between Th1- and Th2-dominated responses. On the other hand, CCR3 was found only occasionally in a small proportion of allergen-specific memory T cells with Th2/ThO profile of cytokine production in vitro. However, it was neither seen in Th2-polarized activated naive T cells nor in established Th2 clones and could be detected in vivo only on non-T cells. Finally, whereas CXCR4 expression was not limited to Th2 cells in vivo, it was markedly up-regulated by IL-4 and down-regulated by IFN-gamma in vitro. Thus, the results of this study confirm the existence of flexible programs of chemokine receptor expression during the development of Th1 and Th2 cells. However, caution is advised in interpreting these receptors as surrogate markers of a given type of effector response.\n",

      "Abstract: Adhesion to and penetration through the sinusoidal vascular endothelium is a mandatory step for leukocyte migration and accumulation at sites of liver inflammation. This leukocyte trafficking is controlled by interactions between adhesion molecules on leukocytes and corresponding ligands on endothelial cells. We have analyzed the in situ distribution of two recently described vascular adhesion molecules (i.e., endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) and of the lymphocyte \"homing\" receptor cluster of differentiation antigen-44 in normal and inflamed liver biopsy specimens. Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 were absent from normal liver tissue, but they were strongly expressed on sinusoidal lining cells in inflammatory liver disease. Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 expression predominated diffusely throughout the liver parenchyma in acute hepatitis; in contrast, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 was mainly expressed in areas of periportal and intralobular inflammation in chronic active and persistent hepatitis. The \"homing\" receptor cluster of differentiation antigen-44 was weakly expressed on scattered mononuclear cells and on sinusoidal lining cells in normal liver tissue, but it was strongly up-regulated on mononuclear inflammatory cells and sinusoidal lining cells in acute and chronic hepatitis. In addition, reactivity for the cluster of differentiation antigen-44 was found on the membranes of variously sized clusters of hepatocytes in biopsy specimens with acute hepatitis. De novo or up-regulated expression of these adhesion molecules on sinusoidal lining cells in inflamed liver biopsy specimens indicates that these cells actively modulate their phenotype in response to environmental factors, thus playing a key role in the recruitment of leukocytes in acute and chronic liver inflammation.\n",

      "Abstract: Adhesion to and penetration through the sinusoidal vascular endothelium is a mandatory step for leukocyte migration and accumulation at sites of liver inflammation. This leukocyte trafficking is controlled by interactions between adhesion molecules on leukocytes and corresponding ligands on endothelial cells. We have analyzed the in situ distribution of two recently described vascular adhesion molecules (i.e., endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) and of the lymphocyte \"homing\" receptor cluster of differentiation antigen-44 in normal and inflamed liver biopsy specimens. Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 were absent from normal liver tissue, but they were strongly expressed on sinusoidal lining cells in inflammatory liver disease. Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 expression predominated diffusely throughout the liver parenchyma in acute hepatitis; in contrast, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 was mainly expressed in areas of periportal and intralobular inflammation in chronic active and persistent hepatitis. The \"homing\" receptor cluster of differentiation antigen-44 was weakly expressed on scattered mononuclear cells and on sinusoidal lining cells in normal liver tissue, but it was strongly up-regulated on mononuclear inflammatory cells and sinusoidal lining cells in acute and chronic hepatitis. In addition, reactivity for the cluster of differentiation antigen-44 was found on the membranes of variously sized clusters of hepatocytes in biopsy specimens with acute hepatitis. De novo or up-regulated expression of these adhesion molecules on sinusoidal lining cells in inflamed liver biopsy specimens indicates that these cells actively modulate their phenotype in response to environmental factors, thus playing a key role in the recruitment of leukocytes in acute and chronic liver inflammation.\n",

      "Abstract: T cells infiltrating the inflamed liver express high levels of CXCR 3 and show enhanced migration to CXCR 3 ligands in chemotactic assays. Moreover, CXCR 3 ligands are up-regulated on hepatic endothelium at sites of T-cell infiltration in chronic hepatitis, and their presence correlates with outcome of inflammatory liver disease. We used a flow-based adhesion assay with human hepatic endothelium to investigate the function of CXCR 3 on lymphocyte adhesion to and transmigration through hepatic endothelium under physiological conditions of blood flow. To more accurately model the function of in vivo activated CXCR 3(high) lymphocytes, we isolated T cells from human liver tissue and studied their behavior in flow-based adhesion assays. We demonstrate that CXCR 3 not only promoted the adhesion of effector T cells to endothelium from flow but also drove transendothelial migration. Moreover, these responses could be stimulated either by endogenous CXCR 3 ligands secreted by the endothelium or by exogenous CXCR 3 ligands derived from other cell types and presented by the endothelium. This study thus demonstrates that activation of CXCR 3 promotes lymphocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration under flow and that human hepatic endothelium can present functionally active chemokines secreted by other cell types within the liver.\n",

      " Title: Evidence of angiogenesis in primary biliary cirrhosis: an immunohistochemical descriptive study. \n",
      "Abstract: The intrahepatic inflammatory process occurring during primary biliary cirrhosis contributes to bile duct destruction, but the cellular and molecular pathways involved are largely unknown. Furthermore, additional pathogenetic mechanisms may exist. We aimed at evaluating the cellular infiltrate phenotype; the expression of lymphocyte activation, antigen recognition and cell-adhesion molecules; the occurrence of hepatic angiogenesis and the molecules involved. Immunohistochemical investigations were performed in frozen liver biopsy sections from primary biliary cirrhosis patients. CD8+ and CD69+ T cells were predominant in inflammatory infiltrates around damaged cholangiocytes; beta2-microglobulin conformational epitope and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression were enhanced in bile ducts and hepatocytes. Inflamed portal areas showed vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 up-regulation; formation of tubule-like structures (neovessels) by endothelial cells expressing vascular endothelial-cadherin and CD-31; vascular endothelial growth factor expression in surrounding sinusoidal endothelial cells; and enhanced expression of angiopoietins 1 and 2, their receptor Tie-2 and endoglin, suggesting their involvement in new vascular structure formation. The inflammatory infiltrate in primary biliary cirrhosis shows an increased reactivity for lymphocyte activation, antigen recognition and cell- and vascular-adhesion molecules. Additionally, intrahepatic angiogenesis occurs, involving vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietins 1 and 2, Tie-2 and endoglin in neovessel formation.\n",

Because the chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) and MIP-1 beta can activate adhesion and induce migration of T cells in vitro, we investigated their expression in human liver allografts to determine whether they might be involved in regulating the recruitment of T cells to allografts in vivo. Both chemokines were expressed strongly by infiltrating leukocytes during rejection and could be detected immunohistochemically on biliary epithelium, an important target for T cell mediated graft damage. Both chemokines, but particularly MIP-1 beta, were detected on the vascular and sinusoidal endothelium of rejecting liver allografts, where they were coexpressed with the T cell beta 1-integrin receptor vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. In situ hybridization with complementary ribonucleic acid probes showed no MIP-1 alpha or MIP-1 beta mRNA in normal liver but dramatic expression of both chemokines in infiltrating leukocytes and graft endothelium during rejection. Expression was reduced after successful corticosteroid treatment of rejection but persisted in patients progressing to chronic rejection. Increased MIP-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta mRNA expression was already found in biopsies taken at the end of the transplant operation, suggesting that early induction of chemokines, possibly in response to graft reperfusion, might promote the subsequent development of graft rejection. These data demonstrate for the first time that MIP-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta are (1) expressed in human liver allografts, (2) produced by endothelial cells in vivo, and (3) induced early after transplantation. They suggest that MIP-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta produced by graft infiltrating leukocytes and graft endothelium might play a crucial role in regulating T cell recruitment to liver allografts in vivo.\n",

      "Abstract: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) recurrence after liver transplantation has been associated with chronic rejection. Biopsies from 10 patients with post-transplant HCV were examined for expression of adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and ELAM-1, number of lymphocytes positive for their ligands LFA-1, VLA-4, and SLeX, and activation markers MHC class II antigens and IL2-R by immunohistochemistry. The phenotypes of the graft-infiltrating lymphocytes were determined. Results were compared to those for patients with normal graft function or rejection. Five recipients with HCV reactivation and one with de novo HCV had a biopsy available showing induction of ICAM-1 in sinusoidal endothelium (p<0.05) and hepatocytes (p<0.01), and Class II antigens in hepatocytes (p<0.01), compared to normal controls. Lymphocytes in the graft infiltrate expressed LFA-1, VLA-4, and Class II antigens, but IL2-R was not significantly expressed. CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells were observed. In our study, HCV recurrence was not associated with acute or chronic rejection, and the inflammation was due to the viral infection.\n",

      "Abstract: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) recurrence after liver transplantation has been associated with chronic rejection. Biopsies from 10 patients with post-transplant HCV were examined for expression of adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and ELAM-1, number of lymphocytes positive for their ligands LFA-1, VLA-4, and SLeX, and activation markers MHC class II antigens and IL2-R by immunohistochemistry. The phenotypes of the graft-infiltrating lymphocytes were determined. Results were compared to those for patients with normal graft function or rejection. Five recipients with HCV reactivation and one with de novo HCV had a biopsy available showing induction of ICAM-1 in sinusoidal endothelium (p<0.05) and hepatocytes (p<0.01), and Class II antigens in hepatocytes (p<0.01), compared to normal controls. Lymphocytes in the graft infiltrate expressed LFA-1, VLA-4, and Class II antigens, but IL2-R was not significantly expressed. CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells were observed. In our study, HCV recurrence was not associated with acute or chronic rejection, and the inflammation was due to the viral infection.\n",

      " Title: High expressions of caveolins on the proliferating bile ductules in primary biliary cirrhosis. \n",
      "Abstract: An increase in bile ductular structures is observed in diverse human liver diseases, especially in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). These structures harbor the progenitor cell component of the liver. Caveolins are cholesterol-binding proteins involved in the regulation of several intracellular processes including cholesterol transport. This study aims to examine the role of caveolin in PBC. Immunohistochemical and Western blotting studies were performed on human liver specimens obtained from patients with PBC and normal liver samples. The expression of caveolin (CAV)-1 and -2 was determined using specific antibodies. In normal liver, scanty immunostaining for CAV-1 and -2 was observed in bile ductules. In PBC liver samples, the expression levels of CAV-1 and -2 were increased on proliferating bile ductules especially in stage 3 cases, but was sparse on interlobular bile duct in stage 1 specimens. Especially, the regenerating bile ductules at the interface of portal tracts and necrotic areas were immunostained intensely for CAV-1 and -2. These phenomena were confirmed by Western blot. The present results demonstrate increased expression of caveolins in proliferating bile ductules in PBC, which may be related to the homeostasis of cholesterol transport in regenerating bile ductules in PBC liver.\n",

In this study we have examined the expression of MAdCAM-1 in human liver. MAdCAM-1 expression was determined in archival human liver tissues by immunohistochemistry. While MAdCAM-1 was not detected in normal fetal or adult human liver, expression was observed in association with portal tract inflammation in a variety of liver diseases. Detailed analysis of liver biopsies from patients with hepatitis C showed a positive correlation between the portal/periportal component of the histological activity index (HAI) grade and the presence or absence of MAdCAM-1 expression.

Inflammatory disease in the liver can also occur in patients with IBD but seems to be independent of inflammation in the bowel. In this Opinion article, we propose that the hepatic complications of IBD are mediated by long-lived mucosal T cells that are recruited to the liver in response to aberrantly expressed endothelial-cell adhesion molecules and chemokines that are normally restricted to the gut. Similar mechanisms might explain why certain diseases are associated with site-specific tissue distributions and might point to new therapeutic strategies that are based on modulating tissue-specific lymphocyte homing.\n",

      " Title: Lymphocyte homing in the pathogenesis of extra-intestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease. \n",
      "Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease is associated with extra-intestinal manifestations which occur either at the same time as flares of bowel inflammation (skin and eye disease) or run a course that is independent to inflammation in the bowel (liver and some joint syndromes). It has been suggested that the skin and eye complications occur as a consequence of the recruitment of activated effector cells released from the gut into the circulation to extra-intestinal site where they cause acute damage. However, this does not explain how patients can develop primary sclerosing cholangitis many years after having their colon removed for colitis. We propose that long-lived populations of memory lymphocytes arise as a consequence of bowel inflammation and that these cells express homing receptors that direct their subsequent migration not only to the gut but also to the liver. These long-lived cells may recirculate to the liver for many years and, in the absence of a local activating stimulus, will not cause damage. However, if they are subsequently activated in the liver this will lead to the development of inflammation and tissue damage which promotes the recruitment of more mucosal lymphocytes resulting in persistent inflammation and disease. The recent findings that MAdCAM-1 and CCL25, previously thought to be restricted to the gut, are up-regulated in the liver during inflammatory liver diseases that complicate IBD support the concept that common mechanisms control lymphocyte recruitment to the inflamed liver and gut.\n",

      "Abstract: The immune system has evolved specialized cellular and molecular mechanisms for targeting and regulating immune responses at epithelial surfaces. Here we show that small intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes and lamina propria lymphocytes migrate to thymus-expressed chemokine (TECK). This attraction is mediated by CC chemokine receptor (CCR)9, a chemoattractant receptor expressed at high levels by essentially all CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes in the small intestine. Only a small subset of lymphocytes in the colon are CCR9(+), and lymphocytes from other tissues including tonsils, lung, inflamed liver, normal or inflamed skin, inflamed synovium and synovial fluid, breast milk, and seminal fluid are universally CCR9(-). TECK expression is also restricted to the small intestine: immunohistochemistry reveals that intense anti-TECK reactivity characterizes crypt epithelium in the jejunum and ileum, but not in other epithelia of the digestive tract (including stomach and colon), skin, lung, or salivary gland. These results imply a restricted role for lymphocyte CCR9 and its ligand TECK in the small intestine, and provide the first evidence for distinctive mechanisms of lymphocyte recruitment that may permit functional specialization of immune responses in different segments of the gastrointestinal tract. Selective expression of chemokines by differentiated epithelium may represent an important mechanism for targeting and specialization of immune responses.\n",

      "Abstract: The immune system has evolved specialized cellular and molecular mechanisms for targeting and regulating immune responses at epithelial surfaces. Here we show that small intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes and lamina propria lymphocytes migrate to thymus-expressed chemokine (TECK). This attraction is mediated by CC chemokine receptor (CCR)9, a chemoattractant receptor expressed at high levels by essentially all CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes in the small intestine. Only a small subset of lymphocytes in the colon are CCR9(+), and lymphocytes from other tissues including tonsils, lung, inflamed liver, normal or inflamed skin, inflamed synovium and synovial fluid, breast milk, and seminal fluid are universally CCR9(-). TECK expression is also restricted to the small intestine: immunohistochemistry reveals that intense anti-TECK reactivity characterizes crypt epithelium in the jejunum and ileum, but not in other epithelia of the digestive tract (including stomach and colon), skin, lung, or salivary gland. These results imply a restricted role for lymphocyte CCR9 and its ligand TECK in the small intestine, and provide the first evidence for distinctive mechanisms of lymphocyte recruitment that may permit functional specialization of immune responses in different segments of the gastrointestinal tract. Selective expression of chemokines by differentiated epithelium may represent an important mechanism for targeting and specialization of immune responses.\n",

      " Title: The chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha modulates alpha 4 beta 7 integrin-mediated lymphocyte adhesion to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 and fibronectin. \n",
      "Abstract: The interaction between the integrin alpha(4)beta(7) and its ligand, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1, on high endothelial venules represents a key adhesion event during lymphocyte homing to secondary lymphoid tissue. Stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha) is a chemokine that attracts T and B lymphocytes and has been hypothesized to be involved in lymphocyte homing. In this work we show that alpha(4)beta(7)-mediated adhesion of CD4(+) T lymphocytes and the RPMI 8866 cell line to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 was up-regulated by SDF-1alpha in both static adhesion and cell detachment under shear stress assays. Both naive and memory phenotype CD4(+) T cells were targets of SDF-1alpha-triggered increased adhesion. In addition, SDF-1alpha augmented alpha(4)beta(7)-dependent adhesion of RPMI 8866 cells to connecting segment-1 of fibronectin. While pertussis toxin totally blocked chemotaxis of CD4(+) and RPMI 8866 cells to SDF-1alpha, enhanced alpha(4)beta(7)-dependent adhesion triggered by this chemokine was partially inhibited, indicating the participation of Galpha(i)-dependent as well as Galpha(i)-independent signaling. Accordingly, we show that SDF-1alpha induced a rapid and transient association between its receptor CXCR4 and Galpha(i), whereas association of pertussis toxin-insensitive Galpha(13) with CXCR4 was slower and of a lesser extent. SDF-1alpha also activated the small GTPases RhoA and Rac1, and inhibition of RhoA activation reduced the up-regulation of alpha(4)beta(7)-mediated lymphocyte adhesion in response to SDF-1alpha, suggesting that activation of RhoA could play an important role in the enhanced adhesion. These data indicate that up-regulation by SDF-1alpha of lymphocyte adhesion mediated by alpha(4)beta(7) could contribute to lymphocyte homing to secondary lymphoid tissues.\n",

Recent evidence suggests that by guiding cells to and within lymphoid organs, CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) essentially contributes to both immunity and tolerance. This receptor is involved in organizing thymic architecture and function, lymph-node homing of naive and regulatory T cells via high endothelial venules, as well as steady state and inflammation-induced lymph-node-bound migration of dendritic cells via afferent lymphatics.

      "Abstract: A key feature of the immune system is its ability to induce protective immunity against pathogens while maintaining tolerance towards self and innocuous environmental antigens. Recent evidence suggests that by guiding cells to and within lymphoid organs, CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) essentially contributes to both immunity and tolerance. This receptor is involved in organizing thymic architecture and function, lymph-node homing of naive and regulatory T cells via high endothelial venules, as well as steady state and inflammation-induced lymph-node-bound migration of dendritic cells via afferent lymphatics. Here, we focus on the cellular and molecular mechanisms that enable CCR7 and its two ligands, CCL19 and CCL21, to balance immunity and tolerance.\n",

      " Title: Naive T cell recruitment to nonlymphoid tissues: a role for endothelium-expressed CC chemokine ligand 21 in autoimmune disease and lymphoid neogenesis. \n",
      "Abstract: Naive T cells are usually excluded from nonlymphoid tissues. Only when such tertiary tissues are subjected to chronic inflammation, such as in some (but not all) autoimmune diseases, are naive T cells recruited to these sites. We show that the CCR7 ligand CC chemokine ligand (CCL)21 is sufficient for attracting naive T cells into tertiary organs. We performed intravital microscopy of cremaster muscle venules in T-GFP mice, in which naive T cells express green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP(+) cells underwent selectin-dependent rolling, but no firm adherence (sticking). Superfusion with CCL21, but not CXC chemokine ligand 12, induced integrin-dependent sticking of GFP(+) cells. Moreover, CCL21 rapidly elicited accumulation of naive T cells into sterile s.c. air pouches. Interestingly, a second CCR7 ligand, CCL19, triggered T cell sticking in cremaster muscle venules, but failed to induce extravasation in air pouches. Immunohistochemistry studies implicate ectopic expression of CCL21 as a mechanism for naive T cell traffic in human autoimmune diseases. Most blood vessels in tissue samples from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (85 +/- 10%) and ulcerative colitis (66 +/- 1%) expressed CCL21, and many perivascular CD45RA(+) naive T cells were found in these tissues, but not in psoriasis, where CCL21(+) vessels were rare (17 +/- 1%). These results identify endothelial CCL21 expression as an important determinant for naive T cell migration to tertiary tissues, and suggest the CCL21/CCR7 pathway as a therapeutic target in diseases that are associated with naive T cell recruitment.\n",

      "Abstract: CD4+CD25high regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a critical role in self-tolerance, as seen in murine autoimmunity. Studies on Tregs in human autoimmunity have focused primarily on peripheral blood samples. A study targeting diseased tissue should identify direct relationships between Tregs and autoimmunity. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 91 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), 28 immediate relatives, and 41 healthy controls, and Treg frequencies were determined as a percentage of CD4+CD25high T cells in CD4+TCR-alphabeta+ T cells. A tissue-targeted determination of frequency and distribution of FoxP3+ Tregs was also performed on 90 different liver tissue specimens exhibiting PBC (n = 52), chronic hepatitis C (CHC) (n = 30), and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) (n = 8). Treg suppression studies were performed on 50 PBC patients and 27 controls. Patients with PBC demonstrated a relative reduction of Tregs compared with controls (P < .0002). Interestingly, a deficiency in CD4+CD25+ Tregs was also found in the daughters and sisters of PBC patients compared with controls (P < .0007). However, functional studies did not reveal a global PBC Treg defect. The level of FoxP3-expressing Tregs was markedly lower in affected PBC portal tracts compared with CHC and AIH (P < .001). In addition, the CD8+T cell/FoxP3+ Treg ratio was significantly higher in livers of late-stage PBC compared with those of CHC (P < .001) and early-stage AIH (P < .001). In conclusion, these data provide support for a genetic modulation of Treg frequency and illustrate the role Tregs play in the loss of tolerance in PBC.\n",

Treg suppression studies were performed on 50 PBC patients and 27 controls. Patients with PBC demonstrated a relative reduction of Tregs compared with controls (P < .0002). Interestingly, a deficiency in CD4+CD25+ Tregs was also found in the daughters and sisters of PBC patients compared with controls (P < .0007). However, functional studies did not reveal a global PBC Treg defect. The level of FoxP3-expressing Tregs was markedly lower in affected PBC portal tracts compared with CHC and AIH (P < .001). In addition, the CD8+T cell/FoxP3+ Treg ratio was significantly higher in livers of late-stage PBC compared with those of CHC (P < .001) and early-stage AIH (P < .001). In conclusion, these data provide support for a genetic modulation of Treg frequency and illustrate the role Tregs play in the loss of tolerance in PBC.\n",

      " Title: Antimitochondrial antibody-negative primary biliary cirrhosis: a subset of primary biliary cirrhosis. \n",
      "Abstract: Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) are the hallmark in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); nevertheless, it has long been recognized that 5-10% patients with typical features compatible with PBC do not have detectable AMA, and they were referred to as  AMA-negative PBC . This study aimed to evaluate whether AMA-negative/positive PBC represents different clinical entities. We compared the clinical, laboratory, percentage of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in peripheral blood, liver biopsy features and response to treatment of the two groups of patients. The first group was comprised of 12 patients with  AMA-negative PBC . The second was made up of another 12 PBC patients with positive AMA. Antimitochondrial antibodies-negative/positive patients were remarkably similar in terms of clinical manifestations, liver biochemistries and histological findings. The frequency of anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-smooth-muscle antibody, anti-gp210 and anti-sp100 antibody showed no significant difference between the two groups. A significantly lower mean percentage of CD4+CD25(high) T cells was observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of AMA-negative/positive PBC patients compared with that of the 12 control subjects (5.8+/-1.8 and 5.4+/-1.4% vs. 7.6+/-1.7% respectively; P=0.014 and 0.004). However, no difference could be found between AMA-negative and AMA-positive PBC patients (P=0.599). After 1 year treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid, the two groups showed similar response. Antimitochondrial antibody-negative/positive PBC patients are similar in clinical, laboratory, percentage of Treg in peripheral blood, liver biopsy features and response to treatment. This suggests that AMA-negative PBC may be a variant of AMA-positive PBC rather than a separate clinical entity.\n",

However, no difference could be found between AMA-negative and AMA-positive PBC patients (P=0.599). After 1 year treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid, the two groups showed similar response. Antimitochondrial antibody-negative/positive PBC patients are similar in clinical, laboratory, percentage of Treg in peripheral blood, liver biopsy features and response to treatment. This suggests that AMA-negative PBC may be a variant of AMA-positive PBC rather than a separate clinical entity.'\"}\n",

      "Abstract: Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease targeting the intrahepatic small bile ducts showing chronic non-suppurative destructive cholangitis (CNSDC). Recent studies suggest that naturally-occurring CD4+CD25high regulatory T cells (Tregs) expressing Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) play an active role in immunological self-tolerance. To investigate whether Foxp3+Tregs are involved in the pathogenesis of PBC. Foxp3+Tregs was detected immunohistochemically in livers from patients with PBC (n = 27), chronic viral hepatitis (CVH) (n = 15), and normal subjects (n = 10). The distribution of Tregs in portal tracts was semi-quantitatively evaluated in each groups. Levels of Foxp3, IL-10, TGFbeta, IFNgamma and TNFalpha mRNA was evaluated in PBC (n = 15) and control livers (n = 21) using semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. In PBC and CVH livers, the amounts of infiltrating Foxp3+Tregs in portal tracts were in parallel with the degree of portal inflammation irrespective of disease. The infiltration of Foxp3+Tregs into portal tracts with CNSDC in PBC was foremost in comparison with inflamed portal tracts in CVH or those without CNSDC in PBC (p<0.05). Focally, Tregs infiltrated into the biliary epithelial layer at the site of CNSDC. The level of Foxp3, IL-10 and TGFbeta mRNA expression was high in PBC compared with normal livers (p<0.05). IFNgamma and TNFalpha mRNA was high in early PBC and CVH livers. Results of this evaluation of Foxp3+Tregs do not suggest that the reduced regulatory function accounts for the development of CNSDC in PBC.\n",

      " Title: CCR8 expression identifies CD4 memory T cells enriched for FOXP3+ regulatory and Th2 effector lymphocytes. \n",
      "Abstract: CD4+ Th2 cells are important regulators of allergic inflammation. CCR8 is thought to play a role in Th2-mediated responses, however, expression of CCR8 in peripheral blood has not been fully characterized. Using a fluorescent form of the ligand selective for CCR8 (F-CCL1), we identified the leukocytes expressing CCR8 in human, monkey, and mouse peripheral blood. CCR8 expression is primarily restricted to a subset of human CD4 memory T lymphocytes (15%). Approximately 40% of CCR8+CD4+ T cells express Th2 cytokines IL-4 or IL-13 while 13% express the Th1 cytokine IFN-gamma. In fact, 50% of all Th2, but only 5% of Th1, cells express CCR8. Upon anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAb-mediated activation, CCR8+CD4+ T cells secrete 3- to 7-fold higher levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13 and 10- to 20-fold lower levels of IFN-gamma or IL-17, compared with CCR8-CD4+ memory T cells. Two-thirds of CCR8+CD4 T cells express cutaneous lymphocyte-associated Ag while the majority lack gut-homing receptors. CCR8+CD4+ cells express CCR7 and CD62L and are present in spleen and lymph nodes of mice. Approximately 25% of CCR8+CD4 T cells express CD25high while 20% of CCR8+CD4+ express the T regulatory cell transcription factor FOXP3 accounting for 60% of all FOXP3-expressing CD4+ T cells. In conclusion, CCR8 marks a diverse subset of CD4 memory T cells enriched for T regulatory and Th2 cells which have the potential for recruitment into sites of allergic inflammation where they could participate in the induction and regulation of the allergic response.\n",

      "Abstract: CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (T(regs)) have been shown to inhibit graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in murine models, and this suppression was mediated by T(regs) expressing the lymphoid homing molecule l-selectin. Here, we demonstrate that T(regs) lacking expression of the chemokine receptor CCR5 were far less effective in preventing lethality from GVHD. Survival of irradiated recipient animals given transplants supplemented with CCR5-/- T(regs) was significantly decreased, and GVHD scores were enhanced compared with animals receiving wild-type (WT) T(regs). CCR5-/- T(regs) were functional in suppressing T-cell proliferation in vitro and ex vivo. However, although the accumulation of T(regs) within lymphoid tissues during the first week after transplantation was not dependent on CCR5, the lack of function of CCR5-/- T(regs) correlated with impaired accumulation of these cells in the liver, lung, spleen, and mesenteric lymph node, more than one week after transplantation. These data are the first to definitively demonstrate a requirement for CCR5 in T(reg) function, and indicate that in addition to their previously defined role in inhibiting effector T-cell expansion in lymphoid tissues during GVHD, later recruitment of T(regs) to both lymphoid tissues and GVHD target organs is important in their ability to prolong survival after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.\n",

      " Title: Critical role for CCR5 in the function of donor CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells during acute graft-versus-host disease. \n",
      "Abstract: CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (T(regs)) have been shown to inhibit graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in murine models, and this suppression was mediated by T(regs) expressing the lymphoid homing molecule l-selectin. Here, we demonstrate that T(regs) lacking expression of the chemokine receptor CCR5 were far less effective in preventing lethality from GVHD. Survival of irradiated recipient animals given transplants supplemented with CCR5-/- T(regs) was significantly decreased, and GVHD scores were enhanced compared with animals receiving wild-type (WT) T(regs). CCR5-/- T(regs) were functional in suppressing T-cell proliferation in vitro and ex vivo. However, although the accumulation of T(regs) within lymphoid tissues during the first week after transplantation was not dependent on CCR5, the lack of function of CCR5-/- T(regs) correlated with impaired accumulation of these cells in the liver, lung, spleen, and mesenteric lymph node, more than one week after transplantation. These data are the first to definitively demonstrate a requirement for CCR5 in T(reg) function, and indicate that in addition to their previously defined role in inhibiting effector T-cell expansion in lymphoid tissues during GVHD, later recruitment of T(regs) to both lymphoid tissues and GVHD target organs is important in their ability to prolong survival after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.\n",

      "Abstract: Leukocyte recruitment to target tissue is initiated by weak rolling attachments to vessel wall ligands followed by firm integrin-dependent arrest triggered by endothelial chemokines. We show here that immobilized chemokines can augment not only arrest but also earlier integrin-mediated capture (tethering) of lymphocytes on inflamed endothelium. Furthermore, when presented in juxtaposition to vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), the endothelial ligand for the integrin very late antigen 4 (VLA-4, alpha4beta1), chemokines rapidly augment reversible lymphocyte tethering and rolling adhesions on VCAM-1. Chemokines potentiate VLA-4 tethering within <0.1 s of contact through Gi protein signaling, the fastest inside-out integrin signaling events reported to date. Although VLA-4 affinity is not altered upon chemokine signaling, subsecond VLA-4 clustering at the leukocyte-substrate contact zone results in enhanced leukocyte avidity to VCAM-1. Endothelial chemokines thus regulate all steps in adhesive cascades that control leukocyte recruitment at specific vascular beds.\n",

      "Abstract: Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is accompanied by inflammation and fibrosis eventually leading to cirrhosis. The chemokine CXCL12 is involved in chronic inflammatory conditions. The role of the CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway in HCV- and HBV-associated liver inflammation and fibrosis was therefore studied. The levels and tissue localization of CXCL12 in liver and plasma of HCV and HBV patients were tested using immunohistochemistry and ELISA. The expression and function of CXCR4 on liver-infiltrating lymphocytes (LIL) were tested by FACS and transwell migration assays. We found that CXCL12 is expressed by bile duct epithelial cells in normal liver tissue. Bile duct proliferation and liver fibrosis in chronic HCV and HBV infection result in the anatomical re-distribution of CXCL12 in the liver. Moreover, CXCL12 is up-regulated in the endothelium of neo-blood-vessels formed in active inflammatory foci and is significantly elevated, compared with controls, in the plasma of patients with advanced liver fibrosis. Complementing these observations were others indicating that over 50% of LIL express CXCR4 and, in response to CXCL12, migrated and adhered to fibronectin. These observations suggest an important role for the CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway in recruitment and retention of immune cells in the liver during chronic HCV and HBV infection.\n",

      "Abstract: Human T lymphocyte transendothelial migration (TEM) was examined in response to chemokines across cytokine-activated endothelium. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), RANTES, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) induced TEM by memory T cells, while stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) induced TEM by both naive and memory T cells. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) increased endothelial adhesion molecule (CAM) expression, whereas interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) induced little up-regulation of CAM. However, both TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma strongly facilitated T cell migration, which was completely inhibited by pertussis toxin and both greatly increased TEM to RANTES, MIP-1alpha, and SDF-1 selectively of memory but not naive T cells. Thus, the dual selective effect on memory T cells of endothelial activation and these chemokines promotes the preferential recruitment of memory T cells to inflammatory sites. However, the enhanced chemokine-induced migration by memory T cells across activated endothelium appears to be independent of the increase in endothelial CAM expression.

      " Title: Differential expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors shapes the inflammatory response in rejecting human liver transplants. \n",
      "Abstract: Graft rejection after liver transplantation is associated with a lymphocytic infiltrate, the nature of which will be determined by, among various factors, the local activity of chemokines that attract particular subsets of effector cells to the graft. The expression of chemokines and receptors in human liver allografts was studied by immunohistochemistry of tissue and flow cytometry of blood and liver-derived lymphocytes. Receptor function was assessed with in vitro chemotaxis. We report increased expression of chemokine receptors CXCR3, CXCR4, and CCR5 on circulating and graft-infiltrating lymphocytes after liver transplantation. Liver-derived T cells responded to the ligands for these receptors in vitro, which suggests that the receptors are functionally active. The chemokine ligands for these receptors were detected in rejecting allografts. CXCR3 ligands interferon-inducible protein 10 and monokine-induced by gamma interferon were detected on sinusoidal endothelium and interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant was detected on portal and hepatic vascular endothelium, whereas the CXCR4 ligand, stromal-derived factor (SDF), was restricted to biliary epithelium. CCR5 ligands have previously been shown on portal endothelium. An in vitro model of T-cell alloactivation demonstrated a similar pattern of expression of functional CXCR3, CXCR4, and CCR5 on T cells. Increased expression of chemokine receptors, especially CCR3 and CCR5, was associated with redistribution of activated Kupffer cells in rejecting grafts. The patterns of chemokine expression in liver allografts during rejection suggest that the recruitment and positioning of lymphocytes is mediated by specific chemokines. Although ligands for the receptors CXCR3 and CCR5 are important for recruitment, the restriction of SDF to bile ducts suggests that CXCR4 may be involved in the retention of alloactivated lymphocytes at sites of graft damage.\n",

We report increased expression of chemokine receptors CXCR3, CXCR4, and CCR5 on circulating and graft-infiltrating lymphocytes after liver transplantation. Liver-derived T cells responded to the ligands for these receptors in vitro, which suggests that the receptors are functionally active. The chemokine ligands for these receptors were detected in rejecting allografts. CXCR3 ligands interferon-inducible protein 10 and monokine-induced by gamma interferon were detected on sinusoidal endothelium and interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant was detected on portal and hepatic vascular endothelium, whereas the CXCR4 ligand, stromal-derived factor (SDF), was restricted to biliary epithelium. CCR5 ligands have previously been shown on portal endothelium. An in vitro model of T-cell alloactivation demonstrated a similar pattern of expression of functional CXCR3, CXCR4, and CCR5 on T cells. Increased expression of chemokine receptors, especially CCR3 and CCR5, was associated with redistribution of activated Kupffer cells in rejecting grafts. The patterns of chemokine expression in liver allografts during rejection suggest that the recruitment and positioning of lymphocytes is mediated by specific chemokines. Although ligands for the receptors CXCR3 and CCR5 are important for recruitment, the restriction of SDF to bile ducts suggests that CXCR4 may be involved in the retention of alloactivated lymphocytes at sites of graft damage.\n",

      " Title: Stromal cell-derived factor-1 from biliary epithelial cells recruits CXCR4-positive cells: implications for inflammatory liver diseases. \n",
      "Abstract: Although stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) plays an important role in hematopoiesis in the fetal liver, the role after birth remains to be clarified. We investigated the role of SDF-1 and its receptor, CXCR4, in 75 patients; this included controls and patients with viral hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and autoimmune hepatitis. Interestingly, SDF-1 appeared up-regulated in biliary epithelial cells (BEC) of inflammatory liver disease. Furthermore, in inflammatory liver diseases, SDF-1 was expressed by BEC of interlobular and septal bile ducts and by proliferated bile ductules. The message expression of SDF-1 in BEC was confirmed at a single-cell level by RT-PCR and laser capture microdissection. The plasma levels of SDF-1 were significantly higher in patients with liver diseases than in normal controls. Flow cytometric analysis of the surface expression of CXCR4 showed that most liver-infiltrating lymphocytes express CXCR4 and the intensity was up-regulated more significantly in liver-infiltrating lymphocytes than in peripheral blood lymphocytes. These results suggest that increased SDF-1 production by BEC may play an important role in the recruitment of CXCR4-positive inflammatory cells into the diseased livers. These data are significant because modulation of the SDF-1/CXCR4 interaction has therapeutic implications for inflammatory liver diseases.\n",

Fifty-nine of 2708 (2.2%) IBD patients had PSC. In ulcerative colitis patients, PSC incidence increased with increasing colonic involvement (P = .001) and was relatively rare in those without total colitis. Thirteen Crohn's disease patients had PSC, none with isolated small-bowel disease had PSC (P = .03). In study 2, the majority of ulcerative colitis patients with PSC had total colitis, whereas the remainder had disease extending at least to the left colon. In addition, all 10 PSC patients with Crohn's disease had colonic involvement. An inflamed colon, but not small bowel, is important in PSC development and it is possible that bacterial translocation and subsequent portal bacteremia is important in PSC development in IBD.\n",

Between 1990 and 2009, 96 consecutive patients with PSC/UC were seen in the authors institution. Data were evaluated from a database regarding UC activity (median follow-up 144 months). Follow-up was censored at time of LT or last clinical review. Patients with PSC/UC were divided into two groups: 46 did not need LT (no-LT) and 50 were transplanted (LT). There were no significant differences concerning duration of UC or PSC and extent of UC. The LT group had significantly (p=0.002) more clinically quiescent UC compared with the no-LT group. The LT group had fewer UC flare-ups (p=0.04) and required fewer steroid courses (p=0.025) with shorter duration (p=0.022) and less use of azathioprine (p=0.003). There was an increased need for surgery in the no-LT group (p=0.006). Colon carcinoma and high grade dysplasia were more frequent in the no-LT group (p=0.004). The no-LT group had increased inflammation in the colonic mucosa at histology (p=0.011), but without visual difference at colonoscopy. Clinically progressive PSC requiring LT is associated with a milder course of UC (reduced disease activity and less use of steroids, azathioprine and surgery). This is paralleled by less histological activity and reduced incidence of dysplasia and colon carcinoma.  \n",

They are actively involved in the modification of bile volume and composition, are activated by interactions with endogenous and exogenous stimuli (e.g., microorganisms, drugs), and participate in liver injury and repair. The term cholangiopathies refers to a category of chronic liver diseases that share a central target: the cholangiocyte. The cholangiopathies account for substantial morbidity and mortality given their progressive nature, the challenges associated with clinical management, and the lack of effective medical therapies. Thus, cholangiopathies usually result in end-stage liver disease requiring liver transplant to extend survival. Approximately 16% of all liver transplants performed in the United States between 1988 and 2014 were for cholangiopathies. For all these reasons, cholangiopathies are an economic burden on patients, their families, and society. This review offers a concise summary of the biology of cholangiocytes and describes a conceptual framework for the development of the cholangiopathies. We also present the recent progress made in understanding the pathogenesis of and how this knowledge has influenced therapies for the 6 common cholangiopathies-primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, cystic fibrosis involving the liver, biliary atresia, polycystic liver disease, and cholangiocarcinoma-because the latest scientific progress in the field concerns these conditions. We performed a search of the literature in PubMed for published papers using the following terms: cholangiocytes, biliary epithelia, cholestasis, cholangiopathy, and biliary disease.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk of certain cancers. We assessed the long-term risks of malignancies among patients with IBD in Finland. METHODS. A total of 21,964 patients with IBD (16,649 with UC and 5315 with CD) from the database of the Social Insurance Institution were diagnosed in the periods 1987-1993 and 2000-2007 and followed up to the end of 2010 in a linkage with the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry. The numbers of cancers observed were compared to those expected in general population and expressed as a standardized incidence ratio (SIR). RESULTS. Overall, male patients with CD and UC had a slightly increased risk of malignancies. Patients with UC were found to have an increased risk of colon (SIR 1.81, 95% confidence interval 1.46-2.21), rectal (1.76, 1.35-2.25), biliary tract (7.26, 4.37-11.1), and thyroid cancers (1.93, 1.28-2.79).

Patients with CD had a significantly increased SIR for cancers of the small intestine (9.97, 4.30-19.6), anus (9.51, 1.96-27.8), and biliary tract (4.93, 1.02-14.4), and also for myeloma (2.84, 1.14-5.85). In addition, the risk of basal cell skin cancer was increased in IBD (1.29, 1.16-1.43). Males with UC had a slightly decreased risk of lung and prostate cancers. CONCLUSIONS.

      "- Abstract: \"OBJECTIVE. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk of certain cancers. We assessed the long-term risks of malignancies among patients with IBD in Finland. METHODS. A total of 21,964 patients with IBD (16,649 with UC and 5315 with CD) from the database of the Social Insurance Institution were diagnosed in the periods 1987-1993 and 2000-2007 and followed up to the end of 2010 in a linkage with the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry. The numbers of cancers observed were compared to those expected in general population and expressed as a standardized incidence ratio (SIR). RESULTS. Overall, male patients with CD and UC had a slightly increased risk of malignancies. Patients with UC were found to have an increased risk of colon (SIR 1.81, 95% confidence interval 1.46-2.21), rectal (1.76, 1.35-2.25), biliary tract (7.26, 4.37-11.1), and thyroid cancers (1.93, 1.28-2.79). The risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) was highest among the youngest UC patients. Patients with CD had a significantly increased SIR for cancers of the small intestine (9.97, 4.30-19.6), anus (9.51, 1.96-27.8), and biliary tract (4.93, 1.02-14.4), and also for myeloma (2.84, 1.14-5.85). In addition, the risk of basal cell skin cancer was increased in IBD (1.29, 1.16-1.43). Males with UC had a slightly decreased risk of lung and prostate cancers. CONCLUSIONS. The incidence of cancer among male patients with CD and CU was higher than that in general population. Patients with UC are at increased risk for CRC and biliary tract cancers. CRC risk was highest in the youngest patients.\"\n",
