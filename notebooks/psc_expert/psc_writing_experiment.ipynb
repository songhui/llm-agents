Abstract='Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are at increased risk for developing cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). However, the morphology of precursor lesions and the prevalence of biliary dysplasia among patients undergoing liver transplantation for PSC are incompletely defined, and the earlier studies using relatively small number of cases have yielded conflicting results. We retrospectively evaluated 100 consecutive formalin-fixed PSC liver explants (including 30 with CCA) by randomly sampling the hilar and large intrahepatic bile ducts (10 additional tissue cassettes submitted per case). The following histologic features were evaluated and quantitated according to the number of ducts involved: mucinous metaplasia, pyloric metaplasia, intestinal metaplasia, pancreatic acinar metaplasia, and biliary dysplasia [low-grade vs. high-grade (biliary intraepithelial neoplasia-2 or neoplasia-3), papillary vs. flat]. Using Fisher exact test and t test, these features were correlated with the presence or absence of CCA and with the following clinical parameters: sex, age, PSC duration, cirrhotic-stage liver disease, and inflammatory bowel disease at the time of transplant. We found high frequencies of mucinous metaplasia (77%), pyloric metaplasia (73%), and pancreatic acinar metaplasia (10%), which did not differ between CCA and non-CCA livers. However, livers with CCA were more likely to harbor intestinal metaplasia (43% vs. 19%, P=0.013), dysplasia (of any grade) (83% vs. 36%, P<0.0001), and high-grade dysplasia (60% vs. 11%, P<0.0001), and also contained greater numbers of dysplastic ducts than non-CCA cases (P<0.0001). The relative frequency of papillary (44%) versus flat (56%) dysplasia did not differ between CCA and non-CCA cases. Overall, intestinal metaplasia was a significant predictor of bile duct dysplasia (P=0.0005) and CCA (P=0.013), low-grade dysplasia predicted high-grade dysplasia (P<0.0001) and CCA (P=0.0004), and high-grade dysplasia predicted CCA (P<0.0001). Among the clinical parameters, there were no significant differences in age, sex, history of inflammatory bowel disease, or PSC duration, but patients transplanted for CCA were less likely to have cirrhosis (60% vs. 86%, P=0.008). These data strongly support a metaplasia-low-grade dysplasia-high-grade dysplasia-carcinoma sequence in PSC-associated CCA, and underscore the known lack of relationship between patient age and PSC duration in the development of CCA. Even in the absence of CCA, bile duct dysplasia is still a relatively frequent finding, seen at least focally in 36% of benign end-stage PSC explants. Dysplasia, however, is generally confined to large and septal-size bile ducts and its presence may not be recognized unless multiple sections specifically targeted to the biliary tree are examined.'>]\n",

      "Title: Precancerous bile duct pathology in end-stage primary sclerosing cholangitis, with and without cholangiocarcinoma.\n",
      "Abstract: Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are at increased risk for developing cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). However, the morphology of precursor lesions and the prevalence of biliary dysplasia among patients undergoing liver transplantation for PSC are incompletely defined, and the earlier studies using relatively small number of cases have yielded conflicting results. We retrospectively evaluated 100 consecutive formalin-fixed PSC liver explants (including 30 with CCA) by randomly sampling the hilar and large intrahepatic bile ducts (10 additional tissue cassettes submitted per case). The following histologic features were evaluated and quantitated according to the number of ducts involved: mucinous metaplasia, pyloric metaplasia, intestinal metaplasia, pancreatic acinar metaplasia, and biliary dysplasia [low-grade vs. high-grade (biliary intraepithelial neoplasia-2 or neoplasia-3), papillary vs. flat]. Using Fisher exact test and t test, these features were correlated with the presence or absence of CCA and with the following clinical parameters: sex, age, PSC duration, cirrhotic-stage liver disease, and inflammatory bowel disease at the time of transplant. We found high frequencies of mucinous metaplasia (77%), pyloric metaplasia (73%), and pancreatic acinar metaplasia (10%), which did not differ between CCA and non-CCA livers. However, livers with CCA were more likely to harbor intestinal metaplasia (43% vs. 19%, P=0.013), dysplasia (of any grade) (83% vs. 36%, P<0.0001), and high-grade dysplasia (60% vs. 11%, P<0.0001), and also contained greater numbers of dysplastic ducts than non-CCA cases (P<0.0001). The relative frequency of papillary (44%) versus flat (56%) dysplasia did not differ between CCA and non-CCA cases. Overall, intestinal metaplasia was a significant predictor of bile duct dysplasia (P=0.0005) and CCA (P=0.013), low-grade dysplasia predicted high-grade dysplasia (P<0.0001) and CCA (P=0.0004), and high-grade dysplasia predicted CCA (P<0.0001). Among the clinical parameters, there were no significant differences in age, sex, history of inflammatory bowel disease, or PSC duration, but patients transplanted for CCA were less likely to have cirrhosis (60% vs. 86%, P=0.008). These data strongly support a metaplasia-low-grade dysplasia-high-grade dysplasia-carcinoma sequence in PSC-associated CCA, and underscore the known lack of relationship between patient age and PSC duration in the development of CCA. Even in the absence of CCA, bile duct dysplasia is still a relatively frequent finding, seen at least focally in 36% of benign end-stage PSC explants. Dysplasia, however, is generally confined to large and septal-size bile ducts and its presence may not be recognized unless multiple sections specifically targeted to the biliary tree are examined.\n",

Abstract='To investigate whether sclerosing cholangitis with an autoimmune serology characteristic of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and AIH are distinct entities, we studied 55 consecutive children with clinical and/or biochemical evidence of liver disease and circulating antinuclear (ANA), anti-smooth muscle (SMA), and/or liver-kidney-microsomal type 1 (LKM1) autoantibodies. They underwent liver biopsy, direct cholangiography, sigmoidoscopy, and rectal biopsy at presentation. Twenty-eight were diagnosed as AIH in the absence and 27 autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (ASC) in the presence of radiological features of cholangiopathy. Twenty-six ASC and 20 AIH had ANA and/or SMA; 1 ASC and 8 AIH LKM1 autoantibody. Similarities between the 2 conditions included most clinical and biochemical parameters and a lower frequency of HLA DR4. Inflammatory bowel disease and histological biliary changes were more common in ASC; coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, lymphocytic periportal hepatitis, and HLA DR3 were more common in AIH. Histological biliary changes were observed in 65% of ASC and 31% of AIH patients. Eighty-nine percent responded to immunosuppression. Follow-up liver biopsies from 17 ASC and 18 AIH patients had similarly reduced inflammatory activity and no progression to cirrhosis. Sixteen follow-up cholangiograms from AIH patients and 9 from ASC patients were unchanged, while 8 ASC patients showed a progressive cholangiopathy. One child with AIH and ulcerative colitis developed sclerosing cholangitis 8 years after presentation. At 2 to 16 years (median, 7 years) from presentation, all patients are alive, including 4 ASC patients who underwent liver transplantation. In conclusion, ASC and AIH are similarly prevalent in childhood; cholangiography is often needed to distinguish between these 2 entities, which are likely to lie within the same disease process.'>]\n",

      "Title: Autoimmune hepatitis/sclerosing cholangitis overlap syndrome in childhood: a 16-year prospective study.  \n",
      "Abstract: To investigate whether sclerosing cholangitis with an autoimmune serology characteristic of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and AIH are distinct entities, we studied 55 consecutive children with clinical and/or biochemical evidence of liver disease and circulating antinuclear (ANA), anti-smooth muscle (SMA), and/or liver-kidney-microsomal type 1 (LKM1) autoantibodies. They underwent liver biopsy, direct cholangiography, sigmoidoscopy, and rectal biopsy at presentation. Twenty-eight were diagnosed as AIH in the absence and 27 autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (ASC) in the presence of radiological features of cholangiopathy. Twenty-six ASC and 20 AIH had ANA and/or SMA; 1 ASC and 8 AIH LKM1 autoantibody. Similarities between the 2 conditions included most clinical and biochemical parameters and a lower frequency of HLA DR4. Inflammatory bowel disease and histological biliary changes were more common in ASC; coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, lymphocytic periportal hepatitis, and HLA DR3 were more common in AIH. Histological biliary changes were observed in 65% of ASC and 31% of AIH patients. Eighty-nine percent responded to immunosuppression. Follow-up liver biopsies from 17 ASC and 18 AIH patients had similarly reduced inflammatory activity and no progression to cirrhosis. Sixteen follow-up cholangiograms from AIH patients and 9 from ASC patients were unchanged, while 8 ASC patients showed a progressive cholangiopathy. One child with AIH and ulcerative colitis developed sclerosing cholangitis 8 years after presentation. At 2 to 16 years (median, 7 years) from presentation, all patients are alive, including 4 ASC patients who underwent liver transplantation. In conclusion, ASC and AIH are similarly prevalent in childhood; cholangiography is often needed to distinguish between these 2 entities, which are likely to lie within the same disease process.\n",

Fifty-two patients (25 female, 27 male; mean age, 43 years; age range, 11-87 years) with PSC underwent nonenhanced and gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging. Two abdominal radiologists retrospectively reviewed all images (independently and then in consensus) for the imaging pattern of the liver parenchyma, presence and grade of intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, and presence of areas of parenchymal atrophy or abnormal signal intensity and/or gadolinium enhancement. Imaging findings were correlated with Child class, Child-Turcotte-Pugh score, and Mayo end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. Statistical analyses (kappa scoring for interobserver agreement, McNemar test, Mann-Whitney U test, multiple regression analysis, Spearman correlation) were performed. Of 52 patients, seven (13%) had no imaging findings of cirrhosis, 17 (33%) had a diffuse pattern of cirrhosis, and 28 (54%) had a large macronodular pattern (with nodules >or=3 cm) (kappa = 0.84). Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation was observed in 44 (85%) patients and was general in 18 (35%) and segmental in 26 (50%). Peripheral wedge-shaped areas of parenchyma were observed with atrophy in 23 (44%) and 25 (48%) patients by the two readers (kappa = 0.76) and without atrophy in 18 (35%) patients by both readers (kappa = 1.00). No correlation was found between imaging findings and clinical scores (P >.05, multiple regression analysis; P =.25-.75, Mann-Whitney U test; Spearman correlation coefficients between -0.33 and 0.33).

Abstract='Survival after liver transplantation (LTX) has decreased in Germany since the implementation of Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD)-based liver allocation. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is known for its otherwise excellent outcome after LTX. The influence of MELD-based liver allocation and subsequent allocation policy alterations on the outcome of LTX for PSC is analyzed. This is a retrospective observational study including 126 consecutive patients treated with LTX for PSC between January 1, 1999 and August 31, 2012. The PSC cohort was further compared to all other indications for LTX in the study period (n=1420) with a mean follow-up of 7.9 years (SD 3.2). Multivariate risk-adjusted analyses were performed. Alterations of allocation policy have been taken into account systematically. Transplant recipients suffering from PSC are significantly younger (p<0.001), can be discharged earlier (p=0.018), and have lower 3-month mortality than patients with other indications (p=0.044). The observed time on the waiting list is significantly longer for patients with PSC (p<0.001), and there is a trend toward lower match MELD points in the PSC cohort (p=0.052). No improvement in means of short-term mortality could be shown in relation to alterations of allocation policy within the MELD era (p=0.375). Survival rates of the pre-MELD era did not differ significantly from those of the MELD era (p=0.097) in multivariate risk-adjusted analysis. Patients in the MELD era suffered pre-transplant significantly more frequently from dominant bile duct stenosis (p=0.071, p=0.059, p=0.048, respectively; chi2). Progress is stagnating in LTX for PSC. Current liver allocation for PSC patients should be reconsidered.'>]\n",

      "Abstract: Survival after liver transplantation (LTX) has decreased in Germany since the implementation of Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD)-based liver allocation. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is known for its otherwise excellent outcome after LTX. The influence of MELD-based liver allocation and subsequent allocation policy alterations on the outcome of LTX for PSC is analyzed. This is a retrospective observational study including 126 consecutive patients treated with LTX for PSC between January 1, 1999 and August 31, 2012. The PSC cohort was further compared to all other indications for LTX in the study period (n=1420) with a mean follow-up of 7.9 years (SD 3.2). Multivariate risk-adjusted analyses were performed. Alterations of allocation policy have been taken into account systematically. Transplant recipients suffering from PSC are significantly younger (p<0.001), can be discharged earlier (p=0.018), and have lower 3-month mortality than patients with other indications (p=0.044). The observed time on the waiting list is significantly longer for patients with PSC (p<0.001), and there is a trend toward lower match MELD points in the PSC cohort (p=0.052). No improvement in means of short-term mortality could be shown in relation to alterations of allocation policy within the MELD era (p=0.375). Survival rates of the pre-MELD era did not differ significantly from those of the MELD era (p=0.097) in multivariate risk-adjusted analysis. Patients in the MELD era suffered pre-transplant significantly more frequently from dominant bile duct stenosis (p=0.071, p=0.059, p=0.048, respectively; chi2). Progress is stagnating in LTX for PSC. Current liver allocation for PSC patients should be reconsidered. \n",

      "Title: The impact of inflammatory bowel disease post-liver transplantation for primary sclerosing cholangitis  \n",
      "Abstract: An association between primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is well recognized. However, the disease course of IBD following liver transplantation (LT) for PSC remains ill-defined. We aimed to assess the impact of IBD in patients that had undergone LT for PSC to help identify risk factors for flare and to assess the impact of IBD on graft survival. 110 patients underwent LT for PSC (Oct 1990-Aug 2009) at King s College Hospital. 74 (67%) patients had concurrent IBD and 36 had PSC alone prior to transplant. 39 patients developed IBD (flare of IBD and de-novo) post transplant. Cumulative risk for IBD at 1-, 2-, 5- and 10-years was 16%, 24%, 38% and 72% respectively. Flare of IBD occurred in 33 patients with a mean time to flare of 30 ± 28 months. De-novo IBD occurred in 6 patients (all UC). Mean time to diagnosis was 29 ± 25 months. Multivariate cox-regression analysis identified active IBD at time of LT as a significant predictor of graft failure post LT (HR 10, CI 3-39, P = 0.001) and smoking at time of transplantation and subsequent cessation predictive of recurrent IBD post transplantation (HR 17, 2-180, P = 0.02). In conclusion, smoking at time of LT was predictive of flare of IBD and active IBD at time of transplantation had a significant effect on graft survival. Medical therapy needs to be maximised in the pre-LT period. Patients with poorly controlled IBD refractory to medical therapy should be considered for colectomy at time of transplantation.  \n",

To test this hypothesis, we examined patients in the United Network for Organ Sharing database from December 1, 1994, to May 31, 2009. In multivariable models conditioned on transplant center, patients with PSC were significantly more likely to receive a living donor transplant in both the pre-MELD (odds ratio [OR]=2.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.20-3.44) and post-MELD eras (OR=4.08; 95% CI, 3.45-4.82). There was a significant interaction between PSC and post-MELD era of transplantation (OR=1.48; 95% CI, 1.11-1.97), indicating that patients with PSC were more likely to receive living donor transplants at baseline relative to patients without PSC, and that this effect was magnified following the introduction of the MELD score.

The phenomenon of hypercoagulation is associated with complications in many populations, but the incidence in liver transplant recipients is unclear. We performed a retrospective database review of intraoperative thromboelastography (TEG) for 124 liver transplant recipients.

Patients with cholestatic pathologies had particularly high rates of hypercoagulation (42.9% with primary biliary cirrhosis and 85.7% with primary sclerosing cholangitis), but hypercoagulation was also common in patients with fulminant hepatic failure (50%) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (37.5%).

There was a poor correlation between the TEG R time and the international normalized (INR), with 37.7% of TEG analyses demonstrating a short R time with an INR > 2. Six of the patients developed early hepatic artery thrombosis (5%); 3 of these patients had TEG evidence of high G values (P = 0.25), and 4 had short R times (not significant). In conclusion, intraoperative TEG evidence of high G values and short R times is relatively common in liver transplantation. It is unclear what bearing this condition has on thrombotic complications. Conventional coagulation tests have no ability to diagnose this condition. It is conceivable that such patients may come to harm if hypercoagulability is unrecognized and, therefore, inappropriately managed.\n",

Some of these complications may be life-threatening. The phenomenon of hypercoagulation is associated with complications in many populations, but the incidence in liver transplant recipients is unclear. We performed a retrospective database review of intraoperative thromboelastography (TEG) for 124 liver transplant recipients. We assessed the prevalence of hypercoagulation in this group and investigated the relative frequency of both shortened TEG reaction times (R times) and increased net clot strength (G) values. These findings were correlated with thrombotic complications. At the baseline, the prevalence of high G values was 15.53% on native TEG, and the prevalence of shortened R times was 6.80% on native-heparinase TEG.

      "Abstract: This meta-analysis aimed to compare outcomes following bile duct reconstruction in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) undergoing liver transplantation depending on whether duct-to-duct or Roux-en-Y anastomosis was utilized. An electronic search was performed of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed databases using both subject headings (MeSH) and truncated word searches. Pooled risk ratios and mean difference were calculated using the fixed-effects and random-effects models for meta-analysis. Ten studies including 910 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was no difference in the overall incidence of biliary strictures between the two groups [odds ratio (OR) 1.06 (0.68, 1.66); (P = 0.80)]. The anastomotic stricture rate was similar, [OR 1.18 (0.56, 2.50); (P = 0.67)]. Ascending cholangitis was higher in the Roux-en-Y group [OR 2.91 (1.17, 7.23); (P = 0.02)]. Anastomotic bile leak rates, graft survival, PSC recurrence and number of patients diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma following transplantation were comparable between both groups. Duct-to-duct and Roux-en-Y reconstruction had comparable outcomes. Both techniques are associated with similar incidence of biliary stricture. The bilioenteric reconstruction was associated with a higher risk of cholangitis. The incidence of de novo cholangiocarcinoma was similar in both groups. Duct-to-duct reconstruction should be considered when feasible in patients with PSC.  \n",

BS was diagnosed in 36.1% after a mean time of 3.9 years, and recPSC was diagnosed in 20.3% after 4.6 years. Both entities had a significant impact on longterm graft and recipient survival. Independent risk factors for BS were donor age, ulcerative colitis, chronic ductopenic rejection, bilirubin, and international normalized ratio (INR) at LT. Independent risk factors for recPSC were donor age, IBD, and INR at LT. These variables were able to categorize patients into risk groups for BS and recPSC.

The 1-, 5-, and 10-year recipient and graft survival was 90.7%, 84.8%, 79.4% and 79.1%, 69.0%, 62.4%, respectively. BS was diagnosed in 36.1% after a mean time of 3.9 years, and recPSC was diagnosed in 20.3% after 4.6 years. Both entities had a significant impact on longterm graft and recipient survival. Independent risk factors for BS were donor age, ulcerative colitis, chronic ductopenic rejection, bilirubin, and international normalized ratio (INR) at LT. Independent risk factors for recPSC were donor age, IBD, and INR at LT. These variables were able to categorize patients into risk groups for BS and recPSC. In conclusion, BS and recPSC affect longterm graft and patient survival after LT for PSC. Donor age, IBD, and INR at LT are independent risk factors for BS and recPSC and allow for risk estimation depending on the recipient-donor constellation.\n",

Although the cumulative incidence of colorectal neoplasia was higher in cases (33%) than in controls (13%) at five years, this was of borderline statistical significance (p=0.054, unmatched log rank test). Overall survival from first clinic visit was significantly worse among cases (79% v 97%) at five years (p<0.001, unmatched log rank test).

To describe the clinical features and outcomes of PSC-IBD and compare these to a group of chronic ulcerative colitis (CUC) patients. The medical records of all patients with PSC-IBD evaluated at the Mayo Clinic Rochester between 1987 and 1992 were abstracted for information on endoscopic and histological features, colorectal neoplasia, surgery, and other clinical outcomes.

A control group of CUC patients matched for sex, duration of IBD at first clinic visit, and calendar year of first clinic visit was identified, and similar information was abstracted. Seventy one PSC-IBD patients and 142 CUC patients without PSC were identified. Rectal sparing and backwash ileitis were more common in the PSC-IBD group (52% and 51%, respectively) than in controls (6% and 7%, respectively).

Abstract='To review the current literature for the specific clinical characteristics of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). A systematical review for clinical characteristics of IBD in PSC was performed by conducting a broad search for \"primary sclerosing cholangitis\" in Pubmed. \"Clinical characteristics\" were specified into five predefined subthemes: epidemiology of IBD in PSC, characteristics of IBD in PSC (i.e., location, disease behavior), risk of colorectal cancer development, IBD recurrence and de novo disease after liver transplantation for PSC, and safety and complications after proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Papers were selected for inclusion based on their relevance to the subthemes, and were reviewed by two independent reviewers. Only full papers relevant to PSC-IBD were included. Additionally the references of recent reviews for PSC (< 5 years old) were scrutinized for relevant articles. Initial literature search for PSC yielded 4704 results. After careful review 65 papers, comprising a total of 11406 PSC-IBD patients, were selected and divided according to subtheme. Four manuscripts overlapped and were included in two subthemes. Prevalence of IBD in PSC shows a large variance, ranging from 46.5% to 98.7% with ulcerative colitis (UC) being the most common type (> 75%). The highest IBD rates in PSC are found in papers reviewing both endoscopic and histological data for IBD diagnosis. Although IBD in PSC is found to be a quiescent disease, pancolitis occurs often, with rates varying from 35% to 95%. Both backwash ileitis and rectal sparing are observed infrequently. The development of dysplasia or colorectal carcinoma is increased in PSC-IBD; the cumulative 10 years risk varying between 0% and 11%. Exacerbation of IBD is common after liver transplantation for PSC and de novo disease is seen in 1.3% to 31.3% of PSC-IBD patients. The risk for development of pouchitis in PSC-IBD is found to be significant, affecting 13.8% to 90% of the patients after proctocolectomy with ileo anal-pouch anastomosis.

Although IBD in PSC is found to be a quiescent disease, pancolitis occurs often, with rates varying from 35% to 95%. Both backwash ileitis and rectal sparing are observed infrequently. The development of dysplasia or colorectal carcinoma is increased in PSC-IBD; the cumulative 10 years risk varying between 0% and 11%. Exacerbation of IBD is common after liver transplantation for PSC and de novo disease is seen in 1.3% to 31.3% of PSC-IBD patients. The risk for development of pouchitis in PSC-IBD is found to be significant, affecting 13.8% to 90% of the patients after proctocolectomy with ileo anal-pouch anastomosis. IBD in primary sclerosing cholangitis represents a distinct phenotype that differs from UC and Crohn's disease and therefore requires specialized management.  \n",

      "Abstract: To review the current literature for the specific clinical characteristics of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). A systematical review for clinical characteristics of IBD in PSC was performed by conducting a broad search for \"primary sclerosing cholangitis\" in Pubmed. \"Clinical characteristics\" were specified into five predefined subthemes: epidemiology of IBD in PSC, characteristics of IBD in PSC (i.e., location, disease behavior), risk of colorectal cancer development, IBD recurrence and de novo disease after liver transplantation for PSC, and safety and complications after proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Papers were selected for inclusion based on their relevance to the subthemes, and were reviewed by two independent reviewers. Only full papers relevant to PSC-IBD were included. Additionally the references of recent reviews for PSC (< 5 years old) were scrutinized for relevant articles. Initial literature search for PSC yielded 4704 results. After careful review 65 papers, comprising a total of 11406 PSC-IBD patients, were selected and divided according to subtheme. Four manuscripts overlapped and were included in two subthemes. Prevalence of IBD in PSC shows a large variance, ranging from 46.5% to 98.7% with ulcerative colitis (UC) being the most common type (> 75%). The highest IBD rates in PSC are found in papers reviewing both endoscopic and histological data for IBD diagnosis. Although IBD in PSC is found to be a quiescent disease, pancolitis occurs often, with rates varying from 35% to 95%. Both backwash ileitis and rectal sparing are observed infrequently. The development of dysplasia or colorectal carcinoma is increased in PSC-IBD; the cumulative 10 years risk varying between 0% and 11%. Exacerbation of IBD is common after liver transplantation for PSC and de novo disease is seen in 1.3% to 31.3% of PSC-IBD patients. The risk for development of pouchitis in PSC-IBD is found to be significant, affecting 13.8% to 90% of the patients after proctocolectomy with ileo anal-pouch anastomosis. IBD in primary sclerosing cholangitis represents a distinct phenotype that differs from UC and Crohn's disease and therefore requires specialized management.  \n",

Approximately one-third of patients with known IBD improve, and one-third paradoxically worsen, after LT for PSC. Active IBD, discontinuation of 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA) at time of LT and tacrolimus-based immunosuppression may be associated with an unfavorable course of IBD after LT. Approximately 14-30% patients with PSC may develop de novo IBD 10 years after LT. LT confers a high risk of pouchitis after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, although it may not be higher than baseline rates for PSC patients. The risk of colorectal cancer continues to be high after LT for PSC, and is higher in this cohort of patients with PSC-IBD, compared with patients undergoing LT for other indications. IBD does not adversely affect patient survival after LT, although the risk of recurrent PSC in the allograft may be higher in patients with IBD and an intact colon at time of LT. Standard therapy with 5-ASA and/or azathioprine may be appropriate for treatment of active IBD after LT and maintenance of remission. Anti-tumor necrosis factor-α agents are effective, but should be used with caution because of high risk of adverse events.

A randomized controlled trial, including 38 centers from 12 European countries, evaluated the safety and efficacy of three doses of oral norUDCA (500mg/d, 1,000mg/d or 1,500mg/d) compared with placebo in patients with PSC. One hundred sixty-one PSC patients without concomitant UDCA therapy and with elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels were randomized for a 12-week treatment followed by a 4-week follow-up. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean relative change in ALP levels between baseline and end of treatment visit. norUDCA reduced ALP levels by -12.3%, -17.3%, and -26.0% in the 500, 1,000, and 1,500mg/d groups (p=0.029, p=0.003, and p<0.0001 when compared to placebo), respectively, while a +1.2% increase was observed in the placebo group. Similar dose-dependent results were found for secondary endpoints, such as ALT, AST, γ-GT, or the rate of patients achieving ALP levels <1.5× ULN. Serious adverse events occurred in seven patients in the 500mg/d, five patients in the 1,000mg/d, two patients in the 1500mg/d group, and three in the placebo group. There was no difference in reported pruritus between treatment and placebo groups. norUDCA significantly reduced ALP values dose-dependently in all treatment arms. The safety profile of norUDCA was excellent and comparable to placebo. Consequently, these results justify a phase III trial of norUDCA in PSC patients. Lay summary: Effective medical therapy for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is urgently needed. In this phase II clinical study in PSC patients, a side chain-shortened derivative of ursodeoxycholic acid, norursodeoxycholic acid (norUDCA), significantly reduced serum alkaline phosphatase levels in a dose-dependent manner during a 12-week treatment. Importantly, norUDCA showed a favorable safety profile, which was similar to placebo. The use of norUDCA in PSC patients is promising and will be further evaluated in a phase III clinical study.

Abstract='Sera of patients with autoimmune liver diseases were investigated for the presence of autoantibodies binding to human biliary epithelial cells (BECs). Furthermore, their functional capacity was investigated by testing their capacity to fix complement as well as induce expression of various adhesion molecules and production of cytokines. Sera from patients with various stages of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC; n=30), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC; n=29), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH; n=25), and normal controls (n=12) were investigated for the presence of antibodies that reacted with unstimulated and cytokine stimulated BECs isolated from a normal healthy liver. To demonstrate organ specificity, lung epithelial cells (LECs) were used as control cells. Antibodies were tested for their functional capacity. Compared with controls (8%), significantly higher numbers of PSC patients (63%, p=0.001), but not PBC (37%, NS) or AIH (16%, NS) patients, had anti-BEC antibodies. In 90% of PSC patients, the autoantibodies reacted only with cytokine stimulated target cells. Lower numbers of PSC (6%), PBC (10%), and AIH (0%) patients had LEC antibodies. Other significant findings were that anti-BEC antibodies were found in (i) PSC patients with either the HLA-DRB1*0301 or DR2 allele compared with those without (p=0.007); and (ii) in PBC patients with end stage disease compared with those without (p=0.018). Furthermore, anti-BEC antibodies from PSC and PBC but not AIH patients induced BECs to produce high levels of the cytokine interleukin 6. IgM and IgG fractions isolated from PSC but not PBC and AIH sera induced significantly increased expression of the cell adhesion molecule CD44. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot analysis of BEC membranes demonstrated a specific band of 40 kDa with PSC sera and 45, 42, 30, and 33 kDa bands with PBC sera, which were absent in control groups. Thus for the first time we have demonstrated the presence of functionally important autoantibodies to cell surface expressed antigens on the relevant target cells of destruction, namely BECs, in PSC and PBC. These finding have important implications for the pathogenesis of bile duct destruction in these patients.'>]\n",

Other significant findings were that anti-BEC antibodies were found in (i) PSC patients with either the HLA-DRB1*0301 or DR2 allele compared with those without (p=0.007); and (ii) in PBC patients with end stage disease compared with those without (p=0.018). Furthermore, anti-BEC antibodies from PSC and PBC but not AIH patients induced BECs to produce high levels of the cytokine interleukin 6. IgM and IgG fractions isolated from PSC but not PBC and AIH sera induced significantly increased expression of the cell adhesion molecule CD44. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot analysis of BEC membranes demonstrated a specific band of 40 kDa with PSC sera and 45, 42, 30, and 33 kDa bands with PBC sera, which were absent in control groups. Thus for the first time we have demonstrated the presence of functionally important autoantibodies to cell surface expressed antigens on the relevant target cells of destruction, namely BECs, in PSC and PBC. These finding have important implications for the pathogenesis of bile duct destruction in these patients.  \n",

      "Abstract: Sera of patients with autoimmune liver diseases were investigated for the presence of autoantibodies binding to human biliary epithelial cells (BECs). Furthermore, their functional capacity was investigated by testing their capacity to fix complement as well as induce expression of various adhesion molecules and production of cytokines. Sera from patients with various stages of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC; n=30), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC; n=29), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH; n=25), and normal controls (n=12) were investigated for the presence of antibodies that reacted with unstimulated and cytokine stimulated BECs isolated from a normal healthy liver. To demonstrate organ specificity, lung epithelial cells (LECs) were used as control cells. Antibodies were tested for their functional capacity. Compared with controls (8%), significantly higher numbers of PSC patients (63%, p=0.001), but not PBC (37%, NS) or AIH (16%, NS) patients, had anti-BEC antibodies. In 90% of PSC patients, the autoantibodies reacted only with cytokine stimulated target cells. Lower numbers of PSC (6%), PBC (10%), and AIH (0%) patients had LEC antibodies.

Efforts should be made to detect early neoplastic changes that can be radically treated by liver transplantation. In this prospective case series, we obtained brush cytology specimens from bile duct strictures in 61 consecutive PSC patients. The cytological classifications were compared with histopathological findings in bile ducts from explanted livers or clinical outcomes. Among patients with cytological low-grade (n=9; 15%) or high-grade dysplasia/adenocarcinoma (n=13; 21%), 8 (36%) proved to have cholangiocarcinoma and 7 (32%) to have high-grade dysplasia (i.e. cholangiocarcinoma in situ) in bile ducts from explanted livers. The sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative predictive values, and accuracy of brush cytology in diagnosis of biliary malignancy were 100%, 84%, 68%, 100%, and 88% for the combination of low-grade and high-grade dysplasia/adenocarcinoma and 73%, 95%, 85%, 91%, and 90% for high-grade dysplasia/adenocarcinoma only. All patients with high-grade biliary epithelial dysplasia in explanted bile ducts were tumour-free at follow-up. Brush cytology from bile duct strictures in PSC patients can detect cholangiocarcinoma in situ. Patients with cytological low-grade and high-grade dysplasia/adenocarcinoma are currently referred for liver transplantation in our hospital.'\"}\n",

Abstract='Pancreatic autoantibodies (PABs), comprising antibodies against glycoprotein 2 (anti-GP2), are typically associated with complicated phenotypes in Crohn s disease, but have also been observed with variable frequencies in patients with UC. In a previous study, we observed a high frequency of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) in patients with anti-GP2-positive UC. We therefore aimed to characterise the role of anti-GP2 in PSC. In an evaluation phase, sera from 138 well-characterised Norwegian patients with PSC were compared with healthy controls (n=52), and patients with UC without PSC (n=62) for the presence of PABs by indirect immunofluorescence. Further, 180 German patients with PSC served as a validation cohort together with 56 cases of cholangiocarcinoma without PSC, 20 of secondary sclerosing cholangitis (SSC) and 18 of autoimmune hepatitis. Anti-GP2 IgA specifically occurred at considerable rates in large bile duct diseases (cholangiocarcinoma=36%, PSC and SSC about 50%). In PSC, anti-GP2 IgA consistently identified patients with poor survival during follow-up (Norwegian/German cohort: p Log Rank=0.016/0.018). Anti-GP2 IgA was associated with the development of cholangiocarcinoma in both PSC cohorts, yielding an overall OR of cholangiocarcinoma in patients with anti-GP2 IgA-positive PSC of 5.0 (p=0.001). Importantly, this association remained independent of disease duration, bilirubin level and age. Anti-GP2 IgA can be hypothesised as a novel marker in large bile duct diseases. In particular, in PSC, anti-GP2 IgA identified a subgroup of patients with severe phenotype and poor survival due to cholangiocarcinoma.

Abstract='Population-based quantitative data on the mortality and cancer incidence of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are scarce. Our aim was to systematically investigate the survival and risk of malignancy on population-based cohorts of AIH, PBC, and PSC in Canterbury, New Zealand. Multiple case-finding methods were employed, including searches of all public and private, adult and pediatric outpatient clinics, hospital notes, laboratory, radiology, and pathology reports.

This is the first population-based study to examine and compare the survival and cancer incidence in AIH, PBC, and PSC in the same population. The mortality for all three cohorts was significantly increased due to liver-related death, demonstrating the inadequacy of current management strategies.

Abstract='Studies on the epidemiology of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) show variable outcome. We aimed at systematically reviewing the incidence and prevalence rates, as well as geographical distribution and temporal trends of PSC and PBC. A systematic search of literature was performed in Medline and EMBASE (search last conducted January 10th, 2011). Population-based epidemiological studies reporting incidence and/or prevalence rates for PSC or PBC in a defined geographical area of at least 100,000 adult inhabitants were considered relevant. Study area, study period, number of patients, number of inhabitants, incidence per 100,000 inhabitants per year, prevalence per 100,000 inhabitants, method of case-finding, method of case-ascertainment, male/female ratio and in case of PSC, occurrence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) were extracted from retrieved articles. The literature search yielded 2286 abstracts of which 31 articles fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Studies varied in size from 10 to 770 patients in catchment areas from 100,312 to 19,230,000 inhabitants. The incidence and prevalence rates for PSC range from 0 to 1.3 per 100,000 inhabitants/year and 0-16.2 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. PBC incidence rates range from 0.33 to 5.8 per 100,000 inhabitants/year and prevalence rates range from 1.91 to 40.2 per 100,000 inhabitants; prevalence rates are increasing in time. Incidence and prevalence rates of both PSC and PBC vary widely and seem to be increasing. True population-based studies are scarce and therefore large population-based studies combining meticulous case-finding and case-ascertainment strategies are necessary.'>]\n",

      "Abstract: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is strongly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to assess the IBD phenotype associated with PSC in a large well-phenotyped population-based PSC cohort using endoscopic and histopathologic criteria. PSC cases were identified and ascertained, fulfilling well-established criteria, in 39 hospitals in a geographically defined region of The Netherlands. IBD location was recorded according to the Montreal Classification. As this classification does not consider segmental inflammation, backwash ileitis, or rectal sparing, an additional subgroup analysis was performed in 80 cases and 80 age- and sex-matched IBD controls, reviewing all endoscopy and pathology reports filed between 2000 and 2010. In all, 380 (66%) of a total of 579 PSC patients had coexistent IBD, mainly ulcerative colitis (UC) (75%). Overall, 207 (83%) of the PSC-UC patients had a pancolitis, 32 (13%) a left-sided colitis, and 9 (4%) a proctitis only. Seventy (95%) PSC-Crohn's disease (CD) patients had an (ileo)colitis and four (5%) ileitis only. In the subgroup analysis 53 (66%) PSC-UC patients were identified, 24 (30%) PSC-CD patients, and three (4%) PSC-IBD-U patients. Fifty (94%) PSC-UC patients had a pancolitis, compared with 32 (62%) matched UC patients (P < 0.001). Left-sided colitis was seen in 16 (31%) UC controls and in one PSC-UC patient (P < 0.001). Backwash ileitis and rectal sparing were rare findings (<10%) in the cohorts under study. IBD in PSC patients represents a distinct phenotype in that pancolitis is observed in 94% of PSC-UC and colitis in 96% of PSC-CD patients. Backwash ileitis and rectal sparing were rare findings in the PSC-UC patients.\n",

Abstract='Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the bile ducts. Both environmental and genetic factors contribute to its pathogenesis. To further clarify its genetic background, we investigated susceptibility loci recently identified for ulcerative colitis (UC) in a large cohort of 1,186 PSC patients and 1,748 controls. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging 13 UC susceptibility loci were initially genotyped in 854 PSC patients and 1,491 controls from Benelux (331 cases, 735 controls), Germany (265 cases, 368 controls), and Scandinavia (258 cases, 388 controls). Subsequently, a joint analysis was performed with an independent second Scandinavian cohort (332 cases, 257 controls). SNPs at chromosomes 2p16 (P-value 4.12 × 10(-4) ), 4q27 (P-value 4.10 × 10(-5) ), and 9q34 (P-value 8.41 × 10(-4) ) were associated with PSC in the joint analysis after correcting for multiple testing. In PSC patients without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), SNPs at 4q27 and 9q34 were nominally associated (P < 0.05). We applied additional in silico analyses to identify likely candidate genes at PSC susceptibility loci. To identify nonrandom, evidence-based links we used GRAIL (Gene Relationships Across Implicated Loci) analysis showing interconnectivity between genes in six out of in total nine PSC-associated regions. Expression quantitative trait analysis from 1,469 Dutch and UK individuals demonstrated that five out of nine SNPs had an effect on cis-gene expression. These analyses prioritized IL2, CARD9, and REL as novel candidates. We have identified three UC susceptibility loci to be associated with PSC, harboring the putative candidate genes REL, IL2, and CARD9. These results add to the scarce knowledge on the genetic background of PSC and imply an important role for both innate and adaptive immunological factors.'>]\n",

SNPs at chromosomes 2p16 (P-value 4.12 × 10(-4)), 4q27 (P-value 4.10 × 10(-5)), and 9q34 (P-value 8.41 × 10(-4)) were associated with PSC in the joint analysis after correcting for multiple testing. In PSC patients without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), SNPs at 4q27 and 9q34 were nominally associated (P < 0.05). We applied additional in silico analyses to identify likely candidate genes at PSC susceptibility loci. To identify nonrandom, evidence-based links we used GRAIL (Gene Relationships Across Implicated Loci) analysis showing interconnectivity between genes in six out of in total nine PSC-associated regions. Expression quantitative trait analysis from 1,469 Dutch and UK individuals demonstrated that five out of nine SNPs had an effect on cis-gene expression. These analyses prioritized IL2, CARD9, and REL as novel candidates. We have identified three UC susceptibility loci to be associated with PSC, harboring the putative candidate genes REL, IL2, and CARD9. These results add to the scarce knowledge on the genetic background of PSC and imply an important role for both innate and adaptive immunological factors.\n",

      "Abstract: Because the mechanisms leading to bile duct damage in sclerosing cholangitis are unknown, we aimed to determine the pathogenesis of bile duct injury in multidrug resistance gene (Mdr2) (Abcb4) knockout mice (Mdr2(-/-)) as a novel model of the disease. Mdr2(-/-) and wild-type controls (Mdr2(+/+)) were studied at 2, 4, and 8 weeks of age. Liver histology, ultrastructure, immunofluorescence microscopy (to study inflammatory cells, tight junction protein ZO-1, basement membrane protein laminin, fluorescence-labeled ursodeoxycholic acid), immunohistochemistry (for alpha-smooth muscle actin, nitrotyrosine), sirius red staining, bacterial cultures of intra-abdominal organs, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Helicobacter bilis DNA were compared between both genotypes. Hepatic cytokine expression was determined by reverse-transcription PCR. Bile ducts of Mdr2(-/-) showed disrupted tight junctions and basement membranes, bile acid leakage into portal tracts, induction of a portal inflammatory (CD11b, CD4-positive) infiltrate, and activation of proinflammatory (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, interleukin [IL]-1beta) and profibrogenic cytokines (transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta1). This resulted in activation of periductal myofibroblasts, leading to periductal fibrosis, separating the peribiliary plexus from bile duct epithelial cells and, finally, causing atrophy and death of the bile duct epithelium. Bacterial translocation was not increased and H. bilis was not detectable in Mdr2(-/-).

Abstract='The chronic inflammatory liver disease primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is associated with portal inflammation and the development of neolymphoid tissue in the liver. More than 70% of patients with PSC have a history of inflammatory bowel disease and we have previously reported that mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 is induced on dendritic cells and portal vascular endothelium in PSC. We now show that the lymph node-associated chemokine, CCL21 or secondary lymphoid chemokine, is also strongly up-regulated on CD34(+) vascular endothelium in portal associated lymphoid tissue in PSC. In contrast, CCL21 is absent from LYVE-1(+) lymphatic vessel endothelium. Intrahepatic lymphocytes in PSC include a population of CCR7(+) T cells only half of which express CD45RA and which respond to CCL21 in migration assays. The expression of CCL21 in association with mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 in portal tracts in PSC may promote the recruitment and retention of CCR7(+) mucosal lymphocytes leading to the establishment of chronic portal inflammation and the expanded portal-associated lymphoid tissue. This study provides further evidence for the existence of portal-associated lymphoid tissue and is the first evidence that ectopic CCL21 is associated with lymphoid neogenesis in human inflammatory disease.'>]\n",

Abstract='Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and autoimmune hepatitis are hepatic complications associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The expression of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) on mucosal endothelium is a prerequisite for the development of IBD, and it is also detected on the hepatic vessels of patients with liver diseases associated with IBD. This aberrant hepatic expression of MAdCAM-1 results in the recruitment of effector cells initially activated in the gut to the liver, in which they drive liver injury. However, the factors responsible for the aberrant hepatic expression of MAdCAM-1 are not known. In this study, we show that deamination of methylamine (MA) by vascular adhesion protein 1 (VAP-1) [a semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) expressed in the human liver] in the presence of tumor necrosis factor α induces the expression of functional MAdCAM-1 in hepatic endothelial cells and in intact human liver tissue ex vivo. This is associated with increased adhesion of lymphocytes from patients with PSC to hepatic vessels. Feeding mice MA, a constituent of food and cigarette smoke found in portal blood, led to VAP-1/SSAO-dependent MAdCAM-1 expression in mucosal vessels in vivo. Activation of VAP-1/SSAO enzymatic activity by MA, a constituent of food and cigarette smoke, induces the expression of MAdCAM-1 in hepatic vessels and results in the enhanced recruitment of mucosal effector lymphocytes to the liver. This could be an important mechanism underlying the hepatic complications of IBD.'>]\n",

Age (β = -0.62 to -0.21, P < .05) and systemic symptoms (β = 3.84-15.94, P < .05) such as pruritus were associated with lower scores from specific areas of the SF-36; serum level of alkaline phosphatase (β =-1.12 to -0.75, P < .05), and large-duct PSC (β = -15.35 to -10.05, P < .05) were associated with lower scores on mental health questionnaires. The proportion of patients with significant fatigue, depression, or anxiety did not differ between patients and controls (P > .05). Quality of life is impaired in unselected patients with PSC. Fatigue does not seem to be a specific symptom of PSC. Older age, large-duct disease, and systemic symptoms seem to reduce HRQL in patients with PSC.\n",

      "Abstract: Health-related quality of life (HRQL) is frequently reduced in patients with chronic liver disease, but there are limited data from patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). We aimed to evaluate HRQL and its potential determinants in 2 population-based cohorts of patients with PSC and to study the prevalence of fatigue among these patients. Validated questionnaires were used to measure quality of life (the Short-Form 36 [SF-36] and the chronic liver disease questionnaire), fatigue (the fatigue impact scale), and psychological distress (the hospital anxiety and depression scale) in 182 PSC patients residing in Sweden or England. Results were compared with those from the general population (controls). Regression analysis was performed to identify factors independently associated with HRQL. Patients with PSC had significantly lower scores from several areas of the SF-36, compared with controls (P < .05). Age (β = -0.62 to -0.21, P < .05) and systemic symptoms (β = 3.84-15.94, P < .05) such as pruritus were associated with lower scores from specific areas of the SF-36; serum level of alkaline phosphatase (β =-1.12 to -0.75, P < .05), and large-duct PSC (β = -15.35 to -10.05, P < .05) were associated with lower scores on mental health questionnaires.

Abstract='Ulcerative colitis (UC) associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is usually clinically mild. The aim of the study was to assess whether there is an association between severity of PSC and activity of UC, comparing the course of UC in patients with PSC not needing liver transplantation (LT) and those eventually transplanted. Between 1990 and 2009, 96 consecutive patients with PSC/UC were seen in the authors institution. Data were evaluated from a database regarding UC activity (median follow-up 144 months). Follow-up was censored at time of LT or last clinical review. Patients with PSC/UC were divided into two groups: 46 did not need LT (no-LT) and 50 were transplanted (LT). There were no significant differences concerning duration of UC or PSC and extent of UC. The LT group had significantly (p=0.002) more clinically quiescent UC compared with the no-LT group. The LT group had fewer UC flare-ups (p=0.04) and required fewer steroid courses (p=0.025) with shorter duration (p=0.022) and less use of azathioprine (p=0.003). There was an increased need for surgery in the no-LT group (p=0.006). Colon carcinoma and high grade dysplasia were more frequent in the no-LT group (p=0.004). The no-LT group had increased inflammation in the colonic mucosa at histology (p=0.011), but without visual difference at colonoscopy. Clinically progressive PSC requiring LT is associated with a milder course of UC (reduced disease activity and less use of steroids, azathioprine and surgery).

      "Abstract: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), first described in the mid-1850s, is a complex liver disease that is heterogeneous in its presentation. PSC is characterized by chronic cholestasis associated with chronic inflammation of the biliary epithelium, resulting in multifocal bile duct strictures that can affect the entire biliary tree. Chronic inflammation leads to fibrosis involving the hepatic parenchyma and biliary tree, which can lead to cirrhosis and malignancy. The etiology of PSC is not fully understood, which in part explains the lack of effective medical therapy for this condition. However, we have begun to better understand the molecular pathogenesis of PSC. The recognition of specific clinical subtypes and their pattern of progression could improve phenotypic and genotypic classification of the disease. We review our current understanding of this enigmatic disorder and discuss important topics for future studies.  \n",

They are actively involved in the modification of bile volume and composition, are activated by interactions with endogenous and exogenous stimuli (eg, microorganisms, drugs), and participate in liver injury and repair. The term cholangiopathies refers to a category of chronic liver diseases that share a central target: the cholangiocyte. The cholangiopathies account for substantial morbidity and mortality given their progressive nature, the challenges associated with clinical management, and the lack of effective medical therapies. Thus, cholangiopathies usually result in end-stage liver disease requiring liver transplant to extend survival. Approximately 16% of all liver transplants performed in the United States between 1988 and 2014 were for cholangiopathies. For all these reasons, cholangiopathies are an economic burden on patients, their families, and society. This review offers a concise summary of the biology of cholangiocytes and describes a conceptual framework for development of the cholangiopathies. We also present the recent progress made in understanding the pathogenesis of and how this knowledge has influenced therapies for the 6 common cholangiopathies-primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, cystic fibrosis involving the liver, biliary atresia, polycystic liver disease, and cholangiocarcinoma-because the latest scientific progress in the field concerns these conditions.

      "Title: The Cholangiopathies.  \n",
      "Abstract:  Cholangiocytes (ie, the epithelial cells that line the bile ducts) are an important subset of liver cells. They are actively involved in the modification of bile volume and composition, are activated by interactions with endogenous and exogenous stimuli (eg, microorganisms, drugs), and participate in liver injury and repair. The term cholangiopathies refers to a category of chronic liver diseases that share a central target: the cholangiocyte. The cholangiopathies account for substantial morbidity and mortality given their progressive nature, the challenges associated with clinical management, and the lack of effective medical therapies. Thus, cholangiopathies usually result in end-stage liver disease requiring liver transplant to extend survival. Approximately 16% of all liver transplants performed in the United States between 1988 and 2014 were for cholangiopathies. For all these reasons, cholangiopathies are an economic burden on patients, their families, and society. This review offers a concise summary of the biology of cholangiocytes and describes a conceptual framework for development of the cholangiopathies. We also present the recent progress made in understanding the pathogenesis of and how this knowledge has influenced therapies for the 6 common cholangiopathies-primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, cystic fibrosis involving the liver, biliary atresia, polycystic liver disease, and cholangiocarcinoma-because the latest scientific progress in the field concerns these conditions. We performed a search of the literature in PubMed for published papers using the following terms: cholangiocytes, biliary epithelia, cholestasis, cholangiopathy, and biliary disease. Studies had to be published in the past 5 years (from June 1, 2009, through May 31, 2014), and non-English studies were excluded. \n",

These patients with small-duct PSC have remained largely unstudied. Our aim was to determine the prevalence and long-term outcomes of patients with small-duct PSC. Eighteen patients with small-duct PSC (7 female and 11 male patients; mean age, 39.9 +/- 15.3 years [range, 13-68 years]) seen over a 4-year period were matched blindly by age and sex to 36 patients with classic PSC and followed up for 32.5 years. Small-duct PSC represented 5.8% of patients (18 of 309) with sclerosing cholangitis. Subsequent endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) performed in 5 patients with small-duct PSC showed progression to typical PSC in 3 patients at 4, 5.5, and 21 years of follow-up. None of the patients with small-duct PSC but 4 of the patients with classic PSC developed hepatobiliary malignancy. There were 3 deaths (17%) or liver transplantations in patients with small-duct PSC (2 after progressing to classic PSC) and 15 (42%) in the classic PSC group. Survival free of liver transplantation was significantly greater in the small-duct than in the classic PSC group (P =.04). Compared with the general U.S. population, survival in patients with small-duct PSC was similar (P =.4) but significantly lower in patients with classic PSC (P <.001). In conclusion, small-duct PSC may represent an earlier stage of PSC associated with a significantly better long-term prognosis.

These patients with small-duct PSC have remained largely unstudied. Our aim was to determine the prevalence and long-term outcomes of patients with small-duct PSC. Eighteen patients with small-duct PSC (7 female and 11 male patients; mean age, 39.9 +/- 15.3 years [range, 13-68 years]) seen over a 4-year period were matched blindly by age and sex to 36 patients with classic PSC and followed up for 32.5 years. Small-duct PSC represented 5.8% of patients (18 of 309) with sclerosing cholangitis. Subsequent endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) performed in 5 patients with small-duct PSC showed progression to typical PSC in 3 patients at 4, 5.5, and 21 years of follow-up. None of the patients with small-duct PSC but 4 of the patients with classic PSC developed hepatobiliary malignancy. There were 3 deaths (17%) or liver transplantations in patients with small-duct PSC (2 after progressing to classic PSC) and 15 (42%) in the classic PSC group. Survival free of liver transplantation was significantly greater in the small-duct than in the classic PSC group (P =.04). Compared with the general U.S. population, survival in patients with small-duct PSC was similar (P =.4) but significantly lower in patients with classic PSC (P <.001). In conclusion, small-duct PSC may represent an earlier stage of PSC associated with a significantly better long-term prognosis. Some patients, however, progress to classic PSC and/or end-stage liver disease with the consequent necessity of liver transplantation.', 'title': 'Small-duct primary sclerosing cholangitis: a long-term follow-up study.', 'doi': '10.1053/jhep.2002.33202'}>>]\n",

We aimed at determining the natural history and long-term outcomes of a large number of patients with small-duct PSC. Data from 83 patients with well-characterized small-duct PSC from several medical institutions in Europe and the United States were combined. Each patient with small-duct PSC was randomly matched to 2 patients with large-duct PSC by age, gender, calendar year of diagnosis, and institution. The median age at diagnosis in both groups was 38 years (61% males). Nineteen (22.9%) of the 83 patients with small-duct PSC progressed to large-duct PSC in a median of 7.4 (interquartile range [IQR], 5.1-14) years. One patient with small-duct PSC who progressed to large-duct PSC was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma but after progression to large-duct PSC; 20 patients with large-duct PSC developed cholangiocarcinoma. Patients with small-duct PSC had a significantly longer transplantation-free survival compared with large-duct PSC patients (13 years [IQR, 10-17] vs 10 years [IQR, 6-14], respectively; hazard ratio, 3.04; 95% confidence interval: 1.82-5.06; P < .0001). Two patients with small-duct PSC who underwent liver transplantation had recurrence of small-duct PSC in the graft 9 and 13 years, respectively, after transplantation. Small-duct PSC is a disease of progressive potential but associated with a better long-term prognosis as compared with large-duct PSC. Small-duct PSC may recur after liver transplantation.

Abstract='Chronic biliary tract disease is the third most common indication for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in the United States. Most patients undergoing OLT for chronic biliary tract disease have end-stage liver disease associated with cirrhosis, but a minority are transplanted in the precirrhotic stage for indications that can include poor quality of life (eg, intractable pruritus or fatigue), recurrent ascending cholangitis, or cholangiocarcinoma. A smaller subset of these patients suffer from severe noncirrhotic portal hypertension that can be associated with histologic features of nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) and/or obliterative portal venopathy. We reviewed 306 liver explants performed for chronic biliary tract disease at 2 institutions during 1995 to 2003 to identify patients who were transplanted in the precirrhotic stage. The following clinical data were recorded: age, sex, type of biliary tract disease, radiology, clinical symptoms, signs of portal hypertension, pretransplant shunting procedures, time between diagnosis and OLT, and primary indication for OLT. Histopathologic data included: explant weight, gross appearance, fibrosis stage (1 to 4), cholangitis, bile duct dysplasia, malignancy, portal vein thrombi, presence of NRH, and presence of obliterative portal venopathy. Twenty-six of 306 (8.5%) patients underwent OLT in the precirrhotic stage (12 females: 14 males, mean age of 46 y, age range 12 to 68 y). At explant, fibrosis stage ranged from 1 to 2 (portal and periportal fibrosis) to 3 (multiple bridging fibrosis). Underlying biliary tract disease included primary sclerosing cholangitis (18 cases), primary biliary cirrhosis (5 cases), autoimmune cholangitis (2 cases), and secondary sclerosing cholangitis (1 case). Primary indications for OLT were recurrent cholangitis and/or decreased quality of life (11 cases), complications of portal hypertension (6 cases), portal hypertension plus cholangitis/decreased quality of life (5 cases), and malignancy (4 cases). Of the 11 patients with portal hypertension as a major indication for transplant, 2 had undergone transjugular intrahepatic portal-systemic shunting and 3 others had portal vein thrombi. Histopathologically, NRH was prominent in 8 of these 11 patients (73%) and obliterative portal venopathy in 6 (55%). NRH was also present in 4 of the 15 (27%) patients who were transplanted for other indications. These results indicate that precirrhotic portal hypertension is a predominant or major contributing factor to OLT in a significant minority (11 of 306, 3.3%) of patients with chronic biliary tract disease. The occurrence of NRH in some patients transplanted for other indications suggests it is a histologic pattern that can precede the development of clinically significant portal hypertension.'>]\n",

The risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the presence of cirrhosis is uncertain-two large cohort studies suggest that HCC is not as common as in other causes of cirrhosis. Although AASLD guidelines do not recommend routine screening for liver tumors in patients with PSC, we recommend MRI/MRCP and serum CA 19-9 levels in patients with PSC every 6 months to screen for CCA, HCC, pancreatic cancer, and gallbladder cancer.

Abstract='Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a premalignant biliary tract disease that confers a significant risk for the development of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). The chronic biliary tract inflammation of PSC promotes pro-oncogenic processes such as cellular proliferation, induction of DNA damage, alterations of the extracellular matrix, and cholestasis. The diagnosis of malignancy in PSC can be challenging because inflammation-related changes in PSC may produce dominant biliary tract strictures mimicking CCA. Biomarkers such as detection of methylated genes in biliary specimens represent noninvasive techniques that may discriminate malignant biliary ductal changes from PSC strictures. However, conventional cytology and advanced cytologic techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization for polysomy remain the practice standard for diagnosing CCA in PSC. Curative treatment options of malignancy arising in PSC are limited. For a subset of patients selected by using stringent criteria, liver transplantation after neoadjuvant chemoradiation is a potential curative therapy. However, most patients have advanced malignancy at the time of diagnosis. Advances directed at identifying high-risk patients, early cancer detection, and development of chemopreventive strategies will be essential to better manage the cancer risk in this premalignant disease. A better understanding of dysplasia definition and especially its natural history is also needed in this disease. Herein, we review recent developments in our understanding of the risk factors, pathogenic mechanisms of PSC associated with CCA, as well as advances in early detection and therapies.'>]\n",

The chronic biliary tract inflammation of PSC promotes pro-oncogenic processes such as cellular proliferation, induction of DNA damage, alterations of the extracellular matrix, and cholestasis. The diagnosis of malignancy in PSC can be challenging because inflammation-related changes in PSC may produce dominant biliary tract strictures mimicking CCA. Biomarkers such as detection of methylated genes in biliary specimens represent noninvasive techniques that may discriminate malignant biliary ductal changes from PSC strictures. However, conventional cytology and advanced cytologic techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization for polysomy remain the practice standard for diagnosing CCA in PSC. Curative treatment options of malignancy arising in PSC are limited. For a subset of patients selected by using stringent criteria, liver transplantation after neoadjuvant chemoradiation is a potential curative therapy. However, most patients have advanced malignancy at the time of diagnosis. Advances directed at identifying high-risk patients, early cancer detection, and development of chemopreventive strategies will be essential to better manage the cancer risk in this premalignant disease. A better understanding of dysplasia definition and especially its natural history is also needed in this disease. Herein, we review recent developments in our understanding of the risk factors, pathogenic mechanisms of PSC associated with CCA, as well as advances in early detection and therapies.\n",

By multivariate analysis, age 54 years or older (odds ratio [OR], 7.8; 95% CI, 3.3-18.3), body mass index ≤ 24 kg/m(2) (OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.9-12.6), and inflammatory bowel disease for ≥ 19 years (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.5-8.4) correlated with the presence of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis was present in 75% of patients with all 3 risk factors but in only 3.1% of those without all of them. Patients with PSC lost 1% of bone mass per year; this rate of bone loss was significantly associated with duration of inflammatory bowel disease. Osteoporosis occurs frequently among patients with PSC. Old age, low body mass index, and long duration of inflammatory bowel disease can be used to identify patients with PSC who might derive the most benefit from measurements of bone density and treatments for bone diseases.\n",

Abstract='Steroid responsive biliary strictures in patients fulfilling criteria for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) have been reported. The clinical course and response to therapy in patients with PSC with elevated immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) levels has not been investigated previously. Patients with PSC were screened for IgG4-related biliary disease during 2006 to 2008 and data were collected prospectively. A total of 33 out of 285 (12%) patients with PSC (18 males) had elevated IgG4 (>140mg/dL) with a median age of 46 years (interquartile range 29-60); 24 could be evaluated. All patients had both intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary strictures. Pancreatic disorders were found in 4 (17%), and 11 of 24 (46%) presented with jaundice; 8 of 24 (33%) received biliary stenting for a median time of 4 months (0-6). Liver cirrhosis was diagnosed in 12 of the 24 (50%). Overall, 18 patients were treated with corticosteroids and 6 patients managed conservatively. Nine of 10 patients with elevated bilirubin had improvement. Alkaline phosphatase decreased significantly at 2 months and at last follow-up. IgG4 levels at baseline were 242 (216-357) mg/dL and decreased to 109 (80-236) at 2 months (P < 0.05) and 174 (115-269) at last follow-up (P < 0.05). A total of 39% had adverse effects of steroids, mostly hyperglycemia. Relapses occurred in 7 of the 14 (50%), but biliary stents could be removed in all. Elevated IgG4 levels were observed in 12% of typical patients with PSC. Prevalence of cirrhosis was high, suggesting a severe liver disease course. Most patients had a good biochemical response to steroids, but adverse effects were common. Future work should be directed at finding therapy that is more effective, better tolerated, and of more lasting benefit.'>]\n",

      "Abstract: Steroid responsive biliary strictures in patients fulfilling criteria for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) have been reported. The clinical course and response to therapy in patients with PSC with elevated immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) levels has not been investigated previously. Patients with PSC were screened for IgG4-related biliary disease during 2006 to 2008 and data were collected prospectively. A total of 33 out of 285 (12%) patients with PSC (18 males) had elevated IgG4 (>140mg/dL) with a median age of 46 years (interquartile range 29-60); 24 could be evaluated. All patients had both intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary strictures. Pancreatic disorders were found in 4 (17%), and 11 of 24 (46%) presented with jaundice; 8 of 24 (33%) received biliary stenting for a median time of 4 months (0-6). Liver cirrhosis was diagnosed in 12 of the 24 (50%). Overall, 18 patients were treated with corticosteroids and 6 patients managed conservatively. Nine of 10 patients with elevated bilirubin had improvement. Alkaline phosphatase decreased significantly at 2 months and at last follow-up. IgG4 levels at baseline were 242 (216-357) mg/dL and decreased to 109 (80-236) at 2 months (P < 0.05) and 174 (115-269) at last follow-up (P < 0.05). A total of 39% had adverse effects of steroids, mostly hyperglycemia. Relapses occurred in 7 of the 14 (50%), but biliary stents could be removed in all. Elevated IgG4 levels were observed in 12% of typical patients with PSC. Prevalence of cirrhosis was high, suggesting a severe liver disease course. Most patients had a good biochemical response to steroids, but adverse effects were common. Future work should be directed at finding therapy that is more effective, better tolerated, and of more lasting benefit.\n",

However, coffee drinking has not been investigated among patients with cholestatic autoimmune liver diseases, primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). We investigated the relationship between coffee consumption and risk of PBC and PSC in a large North American cohort. Lifetime coffee drinking habits were determined from responses to questionnaires from 606 patients with PBC, 480 with PSC, and 564 healthy volunteers (controls). Patients (those with PBC or PSC) were compared with controls by using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables and c(2) method for discrete variables. Logistic regression was used to analyze the estimate of the effects of different coffee parameters (time, frequency, and type of coffee consumption) after adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, and education level. Patients with PBC and controls did not differ in coffee parameters. However, 24% of patients with PSC had never drunk coffee compared with 16% of controls (P < .05), and only 67% were current drinkers compared with 77% of controls (P < .05). Patients with PSC also consumed fewer lifetime cups per month (45 vs 47 for controls, P < .05) and spent a smaller percentage of their lifetime drinking coffee (46.6% vs 66.7% for controls, P < .05). These differences remained significant in a multivariate model. Among PSC patients with concurrent ulcerative colitis, coffee protected against proctocolectomy (hazard ratio, 0.34; P < .001).

Compared to controls, women with PSC (irrespective of the presence of IBD) were less likely to have received hormone replacement therapy (HRT; OR, 0.5; 95% CI 0.4-0.7) and were more likely to have recurrent urinary tract infections (OR, 1.6; 95% CI 1.2-2.3). PSC patients regardless of gender or IBD status were less likely to eat fish (OR, 0.4; 95% CI 0.3-0.6) and grilled/barbecued meat (OR, 0.8; 95% CI 0.7-0.9). In contrast, PSC patients with and without IBD were more likely to consume steak/burgers that were more well done (OR, 1.3; 95% CI 1.2-1.5). IBD (rather than PSC) is associated with smoking.

Functional studies comprised immuno-precipitation Western blots, FACS for endotoxin uptake, and NF-κB activation assays and ELISA for secreted IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Primary BECs from explanted PSC livers showed reversibly increased TLR and NOD protein expression and activation of the MyD88/IRAK signalling complex. Consecutively, PSC BECs exhibited inappropriate innate immune responses to endotoxins and did not develop immune tolerance after repeated endotoxin exposures. This endotoxin hyper-responsiveness was probably because of the stimulatory effect of abundantly expressed IFN-γ and TNF-α in PSC livers, which stimulated TLR4-mediated endotoxin signalling in BECs, leading to increased TLR4-mediated endotoxin incorporation and impaired inactivation of the TLR4 signalling cascade. As TNF-α inhibition partly restored protective innate immune tolerance, endogenous TNF-α secretion probably contributed to inappropriate endotoxin responses in BECs. Inappropriate innate immune responses to intestinal endotoxins and subsequent endotoxin intolerance because of enhanced PRR signalling in BECs probably contribute to chronic cholangitis.  \n",

      "[<Record DOI='10.1016/j.clinre.2011.04.014' Title=\"Will we ever model PSC? - 'it s hard to be a PSC model!'\" Abstract='Cholangiopathies such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) represent an important group of liver diseases of the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts frequently causing end-stage liver disease with significant morbidity and mortality due to limited treatment options. The relatively low incidence of PSC and the difficult accessibility of the human bile duct system for longitudinal studies may represent some of the critical reasons for the lack of profound knowledge in regard to PSC pathophysiology. Therefore, there is an urgent need for reliable, well-defined and easily reproducible animal models to learn more about the pathophysiology of PSC and to test novel treatment modalities. In an ideal world, immunogenetically predisposed animals would develop fibrous-obliterative cholangitis of the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts in association with inflammation of the gut (especially colitis) in a highly reproducible manner allowing to test new drugs.

From May 1989 to July 1995, we enrolled 105 patients with well-documented primary sclerosing cholangitis in a randomized, double-blind study comparing ursodiol (13 to 15 mg per kilogram of body weight per day in divided doses) with placebo. The primary outcome was the time to treatment failure, defined as death; liver transplantation; histologic progression by two stages (of four) or progression to cirrhosis; the development of varices, ascites, or encephalopathy; sustained quadrupling of the serum bilirubin concentration; marked worsening of fatigue or pruritus; inability to tolerate the drug; or voluntary withdrawal from the study. We analyzed data on the 51 patients in each group with at least 3 months of follow-up; the median follow-up was 2.2 years. There was no significant difference between the groups in time to treatment failure (relative risk of treatment failure in the ursodiol group, 1.01; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 1.7). During the first two years of follow-up, treatment was unsuccessful in 17 of 32 patients (53 percent) in the placebo group and 16 of 31 (52 percent) in the ursodiol group. There were also no differences in time to treatment failure for patients with early-stage disease or in time to liver transplantation.

From May 1989 to July 1995, we enrolled 105 patients with well-documented primary sclerosing cholangitis in a randomized, double-blind study comparing ursodiol (13 to 15 mg per kilogram of body weight per day in divided doses) with placebo. The primary outcome was the time to treatment failure, defined as death; liver transplantation; histologic progression by two stages (of four) or progression to cirrhosis; the development of varices, ascites, or encephalopathy; sustained quadrupling of the serum bilirubin concentration; marked worsening of fatigue or pruritus; inability to tolerate the drug; or voluntary withdrawal from the study. We analyzed data on the 51 patients in each group with at least 3 months of follow-up; the median follow-up was 2.2 years. There was no significant difference between the groups in time to treatment failure (relative risk of treatment failure in the ursodiol group, 1.01; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 1.7). During the first two years of follow-up, treatment was unsuccessful in 17 of 32 patients (53 percent) in the placebo group and 16 of 31 (52 percent) in the ursodiol group. There were also no differences in time to treatment failure for patients with early-stage disease or in time to liver transplantation. Ursodiol, but not placebo, was associated with improvement in serum alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and albumin levels at one and two years. In a group of patients with well-defined primary sclerosing cholangitis, ursodiol provided no clinical benefit.\n",

Abstract='Abcb4 (-/-) mice secrete phosphatidylcholine-free, cytotoxic bile and develop chronic cholangitis. The aim of this study was to identify differentially transcribed genes whose products contribute to the liver tissue pathology during this disease. Hepatic gene transcription was measured in 3-, 6-, 9- and 20-week-old Abcb4 (-/-) mice (FVB.129P2-abcb4(tm1Bor)/J) using cDNA microarrays, with FVB/NJ Abcb4 (+/+) mice serving as controls. Focus was on inflammatory-, remodelling- and fibrosis genes. Marked differential transcription of inflammatory-, tissue remodelling- and fibrosis genes found by cDNA microarrays was verified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Liver pathology was quantified by histopathology scoring. Transcription of clade A3 Serpin genes showed early, marked down-regulation. The chemokine genes Ccl2, Ccl20 and Cxcl10 were markedly up-regulated. Tissue remodelling- and fibrosis genes exhibiting markedly up-regulated transcription included: Ctgf, Elf3, Lgals3, Mmp12, Mmp15, Spp1, Loxl2, Pdgfa, Pdgfrb, Sparc, Tgfb1, Tgfb2, Tgfbi, Tgfbr2 and Col1a1, Col1a2, Col2a1, Col3a1, Col4a1 genes. Microarray-based recordings of differential gene transcription of the majority of these genes harmonized with the liver histopathology score. Thus, cDNA microarray-based analysis showed increasing differential transcription of several inflammatory-, tissue remodelling- and fibrosis genes during the first 9 weeks of disease and a tendency towards differential transcription to stabilize at an elevated level from 9 to 20 weeks of disease. Multiple genes regulating inflammation, tissue remodelling and fibrosis not previously linked to Abcb4 (-/-) cholangitis are identified as being differentially transcribed in Abcb4 (-/-) livers, where they contribute to the pathogenesis of liver tissue pathology.'>]\n",

      "Abstract: Abcb4 (-/-) mice secrete phosphatidylcholine-free, cytotoxic bile and develop chronic cholangitis. The aim of this study was to identify differentially transcribed genes whose products contribute to the liver tissue pathology during this disease. Hepatic gene transcription was measured in 3-, 6-, 9- and 20-week-old Abcb4 (-/-) mice (FVB.129P2-abcb4(tm1Bor)/J) using cDNA microarrays, with FVB/NJ Abcb4 (+/+) mice serving as controls. Focus was on inflammatory-, remodelling- and fibrosis genes. Marked differential transcription of inflammatory-, tissue remodelling- and fibrosis genes found by cDNA microarrays was verified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Liver pathology was quantified by histopathology scoring. Transcription of clade A3 Serpin genes showed early, marked down-regulation. The chemokine genes Ccl2, Ccl20 and Cxcl10 were markedly up-regulated. Tissue remodelling- and fibrosis genes exhibiting markedly up-regulated transcription included: Ctgf, Elf3, Lgals3, Mmp12, Mmp15, Spp1, Loxl2, Pdgfa, Pdgfrb, Sparc, Tgfb1, Tgfb2, Tgfbi, Tgfbr2 and Col1a1, Col1a2, Col2a1, Col3a1, Col4a1 genes. Microarray-based recordings of differential gene transcription of the majority of these genes harmonized with the liver histopathology score. Thus, cDNA microarray-based analysis showed increasing differential transcription of several inflammatory-, tissue remodelling- and fibrosis genes during the first 9 weeks of disease and a tendency towards differential transcription to stabilize at an elevated level from 9 to 20 weeks of disease. Multiple genes regulating inflammation, tissue remodelling and fibrosis not previously linked to Abcb4 (-/-) cholangitis are identified as being differentially transcribed in Abcb4 (-/-) livers, where they contribute to the pathogenesis of liver tissue pathology.  \n",

Abstract='Deficiency of multidrug resistance 2 (mdr2), a canalicular phospholipid floppase, leads to excretion of low-phospholipid \"toxic\" bile causing progressive cholestasis. We hypothesize that pharmacological inhibition of the ileal, apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), blocks progression of sclerosing cholangitis in mdr2(-/-) mice. Thirty-day-old, female mdr2(-/-) mice were fed high-fat chow containing 0.006% SC-435, a minimally absorbed, potent inhibitor of ASBT, providing, on average, 11 mg/kg/day of compound. Bile acids (BAs) and phospholipids were measured by mass spectrometry. Compared with untreated mdr2(-/-) mice, SC-435 treatment for 14 days increased fecal BA excretion by 8-fold, lowered total BA concentration in liver by 65%, reduced total BA and individual hydrophobic BA concentrations in serum by >98%, and decreased plasma alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and serum alkaline phosphatase levels by 86%, 93%, and 55%, respectively. Liver histology of sclerosing cholangitis improved, and extent of fibrosis decreased concomitant with reduction of hepatic profibrogenic gene expression. Biliary BA concentrations significantly decreased and phospholipids remained low and unchanged with treatment. The phosphatidylcholine (PC)/BA ratio in treated mice corrected toward a ratio of 0.28 found in wild-type mice, indicating decreased bile toxicity. Hepatic RNA sequencing studies revealed up-regulation of putative anti-inflammatory and antifibrogenic genes, including Ppara and Igf1, and down-regulation of several proinflammatory genes, including Ccl2 and Lcn2, implicated in leukocyte recruitment. Flow cytometric analysis revealed significant reduction of frequencies of hepatic CD11b(+) F4/80(+) Kupffer cells and CD11b(+) Gr1(+) neutrophils, accompanied by expansion of anti-inflammatory Ly6C(-) monocytes in treated mdr2(-/-) mice. Inhibition of ASBT reduces BA pool size and retention of hydrophobic BA, favorably alters the biliary PC/BA ratio, profoundly changes the hepatic transcriptome, attenuates recruitment of leukocytes, and abrogates progression of murine sclerosing cholangitis.'>]\n",

      "Abstract: Deficiency of multidrug resistance 2 (mdr2), a canalicular phospholipid floppase, leads to excretion of low-phospholipid \"toxic\" bile causing progressive cholestasis. We hypothesize that pharmacological inhibition of the ileal, apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), blocks progression of sclerosing cholangitis in mdr2(-/-) mice. Thirty-day-old, female mdr2(-/-) mice were fed high-fat chow containing 0.006% SC-435, a minimally absorbed, potent inhibitor of ASBT, providing, on average, 11 mg/kg/day of compound. Bile acids (BAs) and phospholipids were measured by mass spectrometry. Compared with untreated mdr2(-/-) mice, SC-435 treatment for 14 days increased fecal BA excretion by 8-fold, lowered total BA concentration in liver by 65%, reduced total BA and individual hydrophobic BA concentrations in serum by >98%, and decreased plasma alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and serum alkaline phosphatase levels by 86%, 93%, and 55%, respectively. Liver histology of sclerosing cholangitis improved, and extent of fibrosis decreased concomitant with reduction of hepatic profibrogenic gene expression. Biliary BA concentrations significantly decreased and phospholipids remained low and unchanged with treatment. The phosphatidylcholine (PC)/BA ratio in treated mice corrected toward a ratio of 0.28 found in wild-type mice, indicating decreased bile toxicity. Hepatic RNA sequencing studies revealed up-regulation of putative anti-inflammatory and antifibrogenic genes, including Ppara and Igf1, and down-regulation of several proinflammatory genes, including Ccl2 and Lcn2, implicated in leukocyte recruitment. Flow cytometric analysis revealed significant reduction of frequencies of hepatic CD11b(+) F4/80(+) Kupffer cells and CD11b(+) Gr1(+) neutrophils, accompanied by expansion of anti-inflammatory Ly6C(-) monocytes in treated mdr2(-/-) mice.

The primary endpoint was reached in the low-dose (-43% change in ALK, P = 0.03) and high-dose (-40%, P = 0.02) vancomycin groups, with two patients in the former experiencing ALK normalisation. Bilirubin decreased significantly in the low-dose metronidazole group (-20%, P = 0.03) and trended towards significance in the low-dose vancomycin group (-33%, P = 0.06). Mayo PSC risk score decreased significantly in the low-dose vancomycin (-0.55, P = 0.02) and low-dose metronidazole group (-0.16, P = 0.03). Pruritus decreased significantly in the high-dose metronidazole group (-3.4, P = 0.03). AEs led to medication discontinuation in six patients, four of whom were receiving metronidazole. Both vancomycin and metronidazole demonstrated efficacy; however, only patients in the vancomycin groups reached the primary endpoint, and with less adverse effects. Larger, longer-term studies are needed to further examine the safety and efficacy of antibiotics as a potential treatment for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01085760).'\"}\n",

Abstract='Previously, we have found that the absence of the colon after liver transplantation (LT) protects the patient from recurrent primary sclerosing cholangitis (rPSC). As our previous observation has not been confirmed in other series, we have reviewed our cohort of patients grafted for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) with greater numbers and longer follow-up to reassess the rate, consequences, and risk factors for rPSC. We collected data on patients who underwent LT for PSC between January 1986 and April 2006. Data were collected for cytomegalovirus status, inflammatory bowel disease status, time of colectomy, type of colectomy, donor-recipient gender mismatch, recipient sex, extended donor criteria (EDC), and donor risk index. Accepted criteria were used to diagnose rPSC. Of a total of 230 consecutive adult patients, 61 (27%) underwent colectomy pre-/peri-LT, and 54 (23.5%) developed rPSC at a median of 4.6 (range, 0.5-12.9) years post-LT. A total of 263 deceased donor grafts were used, and 73 were EDC grafts. A diagnosis of rPSC was made in 61 of the 263 grafts (23%). The recurrence-free patient survival was significantly better (P < 0.05) in patients who underwent pre-/peri-LT colectomy and in those with non-EDC grafts. In conclusion, in this larger cohort of 230 patients and with longer follow-up of 82.5 (range, 0.0-238.6) months [in comparison with the previous report of 152 recipients with a follow-up of 52.8 (range, 1-146) months], we have shown that colectomy remains a significant risk factor for rPSC and that colectomy before and during initial LT for PSC confers a protective effect against rPSC in subsequent graft(s).

Abstract='We analyzed the immunophenotypes of hepatic cellular infiltrates by quantitative immunohistochemical methods in biopsy specimens from 20 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), 19 with primary sclerosing cholangitis, and 11 with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis. Specifically, we sought to identify activated T cells, interferon-gamma-producing cells, and natural killer cells. The portal cellular infiltrate in PBC contained a preponderance of CD4 cells in comparison with CD8 cells, with a CD4/CD8 ratio of 2.45:1. The cellular infiltrate in areas of piecemeal necrosis contained mostly CD8 cells. Infiltrating CD8 cells in PBC had the surface phenotype of cytotoxic (CD8-positive, CD11b-negative) cells. Approximately 4% of T cells expressed interleukin 2 receptors. Interferon-gamma-staining cells were rarely identified (in less than 2%). Cells that expressed the natural killer cell markers CD16, CD56, or CD57 were infrequent, constituting approximately 5% of the cellular infiltrate. The composition of the infiltrates was similar in patients with PBC and chronic active hepatitis. Natural killer cells were twice as common in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (P < 0.05) as in those with PBC. The inflammatory infiltrates in areas of piecemeal necrosis were similar in the three diseases and differed from those found within the portal area, in that CD8 cells were preponderant. In all three liver diseases, almost 90% of bile ducts expressed class II HLA antigens. These findings support the hypothesis that cytotoxic T cells of either the CD4 or CD8 immunophenotype but not natural killer cells may be involved in the pathogenesis of PBC and chronic active hepatitis.'>]\n",

Abstract='Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is considered to be a chronic autoimmune disease where infiltrating T lymphocytes have been implicated in the destruction of bile ducts. Altered function of these T cells may reflect abnormalities in the immune response leading to tissue damage.

The proliferative responses to common mitogens such as phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (Con A), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were studied, and the cytotoxic function of T lymphocytes was measured using allogeneic target cells. NK (CD56(+)/16(+)) cytotoxic function was measured using the two cell lines K562 (NK sensitive) and Raji lymphoma cells (NK resistant). Compared with patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and normal controls (without liver disease), in PSC: (1) LDLs contained a low percentage of T cells; (2) there was significantly decreased expression of interleukin (IL)-2 receptor (p<0.001) on activated T cells (HLA-DR(+)); (3) LDLs but not peripheral blood lymphocytes had significantly impaired proliferative responses to mitogens such as PHA, Con A, and LPS (p< 0.001); (4) no cytotoxic activity of PSC liver T and NK cells was recorded; (5) significantly higher levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-1beta but lower levels of IL-2, IL-10, and interferon gamma were found in the supernatants of mitogen stimulated LDL cultures (p<0.001); (6) higher percentages of freshly isolated PSC LDLs contained intracytoplasmic TNF-alpha and IL-1beta; and (7) pretreatment of PSC LDLs in vitro with neutralising TNF antibodies significantly enhanced proliferative responses and allowed IL-2 receptor expression following stimulation. In addition, the impaired cytolytic activity of both NK and T cells was partially restored. Impaired proliferative or functional capacity of liver derived T cells was not observed in either PBC or AIH patients.

The proliferative responses to common mitogens such as phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (Con A), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were studied, and the cytotoxic function of T lymphocytes was measured using allogeneic target cells. NK (CD56(+)/16(+)) cytotoxic function was measured using the two cell lines K562 (NK sensitive) and Raji lymphoma cells (NK resistant). Compared with patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and normal controls (without liver disease), in PSC: (1) LDLs contained a low percentage of T cells; (2) there was significantly decreased expression of interleukin (IL)-2 receptor (p<0.001) on activated T cells (HLA-DR(+)); (3) LDLs but not peripheral blood lymphocytes had significantly impaired proliferative responses to mitogens such as PHA, Con A, and LPS (p< 0.001); (4) no cytotoxic activity of PSC liver T and NK cells was recorded; (5) significantly higher levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-1beta but lower levels of IL-2, IL-10, and interferon gamma were found in the supernatants of mitogen stimulated LDL cultures (p<0.001); (6) higher percentages of freshly isolated PSC LDLs contained intracytoplasmic TNF-alpha and IL-1beta; and (7) pretreatment of PSC LDLs in vitro with neutralising TNF antibodies significantly enhanced proliferative responses and allowed IL-2 receptor expression following stimulation. In addition, the impaired cytolytic activity of both NK and T cells was partially restored. Impaired proliferative or functional capacity of liver derived T cells was not observed in either PBC or AIH patients. We suggest that reduced T cell reactivity in liver infiltrating cells obtained from patients with PSC is due to high local production of TNF-alpha. Our findings indicate that the use of anti-TNF antibodies as an alternative treatment for PSC patients should be evaluated.\n",

Associations with inflammatory bowel disease--especially ulcerative colitis--and with other auto-immune diseases, together with genetic associations, further suggest that PSC may be an immune-mediated disease. The immunogenetics of PSC have been the subject of active research, and several human leukocyte antigen (HLA)- and non-HLA-associated genes have been implicated in the development of the disease. Lymphocytes derived from the inflamed gut may enter the liver via the enterohepatic circulation to cause hepatic disease.PSC may be triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by infections or toxins entering the portal circulation through a permeable colon and, therefore, evoking an abnormal immune response.'>]\n",
