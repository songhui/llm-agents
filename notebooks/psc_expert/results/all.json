Memory CD8αβ(+) T cells within small intestine epithelium are well-characterized examples of T(RM), and they maintain a long-lived effector-like phenotype that is highly suggestive of persistent Ag stimulation. This study sought to define the sources and requirements for prolonged Ag stimulation in programming this differentiation state, including local stimulation via cognate or cross-reactive Ags derived from pathogens, microbial flora, or dietary proteins.

In fact, chronic antigenic stimulation skewed differentiation away from the canonical intestinal T cell phenotype. Resident memory signatures, CD69 and CD103, were expressed in many nonlymphoid tissues including intestine, stomach, kidney, reproductive tract, pancreas, brain, heart, and salivary gland and could be driven by cytokines.

We measured levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α in liver tissues from patients with PSC and the effects of exposure to active vitamin D (1,25[OH]2D3) on expression of CD28. A significantly greater proportion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells that infiltrated liver tissues of patients with PSC were CD28(-), compared with control liver tissue (CD4(+): 30.3% vs 2.5%, P < .0001; and CD8(+): 68.5% vs 31.9%, P < .05). The mean percentage of CD4(+)CD28(-) T cells in liver tissues from patients with PSC was significantly higher than from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (P < .05). CD28(-) T cells were activated CD69(+)CD45RA(-) C-C chemokine receptor (CCR)7(-) effector memory and perforin(+) granzyme B(+) cytotoxic cells, which express CD11a, CX3CR1, C-X3-C motif receptor 6 (CXCR6), and CCR10-consistent with their infiltration of liver and localization around bile ducts. Compared with CD28(+) T cells, activated CD28(-) T cells produced significantly higher levels of interferon γ and TNFα (P < .05), and induced up-regulation of intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1, HLA-DR, and CD40 by primary epithelial cells (3.6-fold, 1.5-fold, and 1.2-fold, respectively). Liver tissue from patients with PSC contained high levels of TNFα; TNFα down-regulated the expression of CD28 by T cells in vitro (P < .01); this effect was prevented by administration of 1,25(OH)2D3 (P < .05).

During immune responses, the egress process can be shut down transiently. When this occurs locally it increases lymphocyte numbers in the responding lymphoid organ; when it occurs systemically it can lead to immunosuppression as a result of the depletion of recirculating lymphocytes. Several mediators of the innate immune system are known to cause shutdown, including interferon alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta) and tumour necrosis factor, but the mechanism has been unclear. Here we show that treatment with the IFN-alpha/beta inducer polyinosine polycytidylic acid (hereafter 'poly(I:C)') inhibited egress by a mechanism that was partly lymphocyte-intrinsic. The transmembrane C-type lectin CD69 was rapidly induced and CD69-/- cells were poorly retained in lymphoid tissues after treatment with poly(I:C) or infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Lymphocyte egress requires sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1P1), and IFN-alpha/beta was found to inhibit lymphocyte responsiveness to S1P. By contrast, CD69-/- cells retained S1P1 function after exposure to IFN-alpha/beta. In coexpression experiments, CD69 inhibited S1P1 chemotactic function and led to downmodulation of S1P1. In a reporter assay, S1P1 crosslinking led to co-crosslinking and activation of a CD69-CD3zeta chimaera. CD69 co-immunoprecipitated with S1P1 but not the related receptor, S1P3. These observations indicate that CD69 forms a complex with and negatively regulates S1P1 and that it functions downstream of IFN-alpha/beta, and possibly other activating stimuli, to promote lymphocyte retention in lymphoid organs.","title":"CD69 acts downstream of interferon-alpha/beta to inhibit S1P1 and lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs","doi":"10.1038/nature04606"}}

Here, we demonstrate that stem cells can be isolated from the bile of PSC patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography earlier in their clinical course and maintained long term in vitro as three-dimensional (3D) organoids that express a biliary genetic phenotype. Additionally, bile-derived organoids (BDOs) can be biobanked and samples obtained longitudinally over the course of the disease. These BDOs express known cholangiocyte markers including gamma glutamyl transferase, cytokeratin 19, epithelial cellular adhesion molecule, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, and anion exchanger 2.

Using cholestatic and hepatotoxic models of liver injury, we compared the development of liver fibrosis in wild-type mice with that of IL-17RA(-/-) mice and of bone marrow chimeric mice devoid of IL-17 signaling in immune and Kupffer cells (IL-17RA(-/-) to wild-type and IL-17A(-/-) to wild-type mice) or liver resident cells (wild-type to IL-17RA(-/-) mice). In response to liver injury, levels of Il-17A and its receptor increased. IL-17A increased appeared to promote fibrosis by activating inflammatory and liver resident cells. IL-17 signaling facilitated production of IL-6, IL-1, and tumor necrosis factor-α by inflammatory cells and increased the expression of transforming growth factor-1, a fibrogenic cytokine. IL-17 directly induced production of collagen type I in hepatic stellate cells by activating the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) signaling pathway. Mice devoid of Stat3 signaling in hepatic stellate cells (GFAPStat3(-/-) mice) were less susceptible to fibrosis. Furthermore, deletion of IL-23 from immune cells attenuated liver fibrosis, whereas deletion of IL-22 exacerbated fibrosis. Administration of IL-22 and IL-17E (IL-25, a negative regulator of IL-23) protected mice from bile duct ligation-induced liver fibrosis. IL-17 induces liver fibrosis through multiple mechanisms in mice.

Recently, CD4-positive T helper type 17 (Th17) cells, characterized by the secretion of interleukin (IL)-17, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Human Th17 cells are generated from Th0 cells by IL-6 and IL-1 beta and maintained by IL-23. In this study, the role of IL-17 in PBC and its association with biliary innate immunity were examined. Using cultured human biliary epithelial cells (BECs), the expression of Th17-related cytokines and chemokines and changes therein on treatment with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and IL-17 were examined. Immunohistochemistry for IL-17 and Th17-related cytokines was performed using tissue samples of human liver. Consequently, the expression of IL-6, IL-1 beta, IL-23p19 and IL-23/IL-12p40 mRNAs, and their up-regulation by PAMPs, were found in BECs. Moreover, BECs possessed IL-17-receptors and stimulation with IL-17 induced production of IL-6, IL-1 beta, IL-23p19 and chemokines. Several IL-17-positive cells had infiltrated damaged bile ducts and the expression of IL-6 and IL-1 beta was enhanced in the bile ducts of PBC patients. In conclusion, IL-17-positive cells are associated with the chronic inflammation of bile ducts in PBC which is associated causally with the biliary innate immune responses to PAMPs.","title":"Periductal interleukin-17 production in association with biliary innate immunity contributes to the pathogenesis of cholangiopathy in primary biliary cirrhosis.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.03947.x"}}

In primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), bile fluid is frequently colonized with pathogens and its strong association with inflammatory bowel disease suggests the contribution of pathogen responses to disease pathogenesis. Interleukin (IL)-17A, the signature cytokine of Th17 cells, was recently described to promote inflammation and fibrosis within the liver. Therefore, we investigated Th17 immune response to pathogens in patients with PSC. Bile fluid was obtained by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, and bacterial and fungal species grew in the majority of samples. In addition, bacterial RNA was stained in liver sections using 16sRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and was detected in the portal tracts in 12 of 13 tested PSC patients. Bacteria grown from patients' bile fluid were then used to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and to assess their Th17 response. Compared to healthy controls or primary biliary cirrhosis patients, PBMCs from PSC patients manifested significantly higher frequencies of Th17 and Th1/Th17 cells after pathogen stimulation. The highest frequencies of Th17 cells were detected after stimulation with Candida albicans, a pathogen that has been linked to disease progression. Immunohistochemically, IL-17A-expressing lymphocytes were detected within the periductal areas of PSC patients. Th17 induction was also noted after stimulation of Toll-like receptor 5 or 7, but not of other pattern recognition receptors tested, pointing to signaling pathways potentially involved in Th17 induction in PSC. We demonstrate an increased Th17 response to microbial stimulation in patients with PSC. These data should prompt further studies investigating the link between pathogen responses, inflammation, and fibrosis in patients with PSC.","title":"Increased T helper type 17 response to pathogen stimulation in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis","doi":"10.1002/hep.26447"}}

Here, we performed the first detailed characterization of the phenotype, tissue-residency properties, and functionality of ILC1s, ILC2s, and ILC3s in the human adult and fetal liver. In addition, we investigated changes in the ILC compartment in liver fibrosis. A unique composition of tissue-resident ILCs was observed in nonfibrotic livers as compared with that in mucosal tissues, with NKp44<sup>-</sup> ILC3s accounting for the majority of total intrahepatic ILCs. The frequency of ILC2s, representing a small fraction of ILCs in nonfibrotic livers, increased in liver fibrosis and correlated directly with the severity of the disease. Notably, intrahepatic ILC2s secreted the profibrotic cytokine IL-13 when exposed to IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoetin (TSLP); these cytokines were produced by hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and Kupffer cells in response to TLR-3 stimulation. In summary, the present results provide the first detailed characterization of intrahepatic ILCs in human adult and fetal liver. The results indicate a role for ILC2s in human liver fibrosis, implying that targeting ILC2s might be a novel therapeutic strategy for its treatment.","title":"Composition and functionality of the intrahepatic innate lymphoid cell-compartment in human nonfibrotic and fibrotic livers","doi":"10.1002/eji.201646890"}}

Finally, because naked Tn5 can be annealed to any oligonucleotide of choice, for example, molecular barcodes in single-cell assays or methylated oligonucleotides for bisulfite sequencing, custom Tn5 production and tagmentation enable innovation in sequencing-based applications.","title":"Tn5 transposase and tagmentation procedures for massively scaled sequencing projects.","doi":"10.1101/gr.177881.114"}}

With the inexorable growth of sequence data volume and CPU core counts, the speed and scalability of read-processing tools becomes ever-more important. The accuracy of shotgun read merging is crucial as well, as errors introduced by incorrect merging percolate through to reduce the quality of downstream analysis. Thus, we designed a new tool to maximize accuracy and minimize processing time, allowing the use of read merging on larger datasets, and in analyses highly sensitive to errors. We present BBMerge, a new merging tool for paired-end shotgun sequence data. We benchmark BBMerge by comparison with eight other widely used merging tools, assessing speed, accuracy and scalability. Evaluations of both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BBMerge produces merged shotgun reads with greater accuracy and at higher speed than any existing merging tool examined. BBMerge also provides the ability to merge non-overlapping shotgun read pairs by using k-mer frequency information to assemble the unsequenced gap between reads, achieving a significantly higher merge rate while maintaining or increasing accuracy.","title":"BBMerge - Accurate paired shotgun read merging via overlap","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0185056"}}

Although many scientific questions can be addressed with broad taxonomic profiles, clinical, food safety, and some ecological applications require higher specificity. Here we introduce a novel sub-operational-taxonomic-unit (sOTU) approach, Deblur, that uses error profiles to obtain putative error-free sequences from Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq sequencing platforms. Deblur substantially reduces computational demands relative to similar sOTU methods and does so with similar or better sensitivity and specificity. Using simulations, mock mixtures, and real data sets, we detected closely related bacterial sequences with single nucleotide differences while removing false positives and maintaining stability in detection, suggesting that Deblur is limited only by read length and diversity within the amplicon sequences. Because Deblur operates on a per-sample level, it scales to modern data sets and meta-analyses. To highlight Deblur's ability to integrate data sets, we include an interactive exploration of its application to multiple distinct sequencing rounds of the American Gut Project. Deblur is open source under the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license, easily installable, and downloadable from https://github.com/biocore/deblur. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Deblur provides a rapid and sensitive means to assess ecological patterns driven by differentiation of closely related taxa.

{"type":"node","id":"136","labels":["Paper"],"properties":{"abstract":"The transcription of the gene (CYP7A1) encoding cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, a key enzyme in cholesterol homeostasis, is repressed by bile acids via multiple mechanisms involving members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Here, we describe a regulatory mechanism that can be exploited for modulating bile acid synthesis. By dissecting the mechanisms of CYP7A1 transcription, we found that bile acids stimulate the sequential recruitment of the histone deacetylases (HDACs) 7, 3, and 1, and of the corepressor SMRTalpha (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors-alpha) and the nuclear corepressor. Bile acids, but not the farnesoid X receptor-selective agonist GW4064, increase the nuclear concentration of HDAC7, which promotes the assembly of a repressive complex that ultimately represses CYP7A1 transcription. Interestingly, despite its high basal expression level, small heterodimer partner (SHP) is associated with the CYP7A1 promoter only at a later stage of bile acid repression. Gene silencing with small interfering RNA confirms that HDAC7 is the key factor required for the repression of CYP7A1 transcription, whereas knockdown of SHP does not prevent the down-regulation of CYP7A1. Administration of the HDAC inhibitors valproic acid or trichostatin A to genetically hypercholesterolemic mice increases Cyp7a1 messenger RNA and bile acid synthesis and consequently markedly reduces total plasma and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. By using a combination of molecular, cellular, and animal models, our study highlights the importance of HDACs in the feedback regulation of CYP7A1 transcription and identifies these enzymes as potential targets to modulate bile acid synthesis and for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.","title":"Insights in the regulation of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene reveal a target for modulating bile acid synthesis","doi":"10.1002/hep.21819"}}

We aimed to extensively investigate TGR5 sequence variation in PSC, as well as functionally characterize detected variants. Complete resequencing of TGR5 was performed in 267 PSC patients and 274 healthy controls. Six nonsynonymous mutations were identified in addition to 16 other novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms. To investigate the impact from the nonsynonymous variants on TGR5, we created a receptor model, and introduced mutated TGR5 constructs into human epithelial cell lines. By using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and a cAMP-sensitive luciferase assay, five of the nonsynonymous mutations (W83R, V178M, A217P, S272G and Q296X) were found to reduce or abolish TGR5 function. Fine-mapping of the previously reported PSC and UC associated locus at chromosome 2q35 in large patient panels revealed an overall association between the TGR5 single-nucleotide polymorphism rs11554825 and PSC (odds ratio = 1.14, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-1.26, p = 0.010) and UC (odds ratio = 1.19, 95% confidence interval 1.11-1.27, p = 8.5 x 10(-7)), but strong linkage disequilibrium precluded demarcation of TGR5 from neighboring genes.

{"type":"node","id":"138","labels":["Paper"],"properties":{"abstract":"Bile is a unique and vital aqueous secretion of the liver that is formed by the hepatocyte and modified down stream by absorptive and secretory properties of the bile duct epithelium. Approximately 5% of bile consists of organic and inorganic solutes of considerable complexity. The bile-secretory unit consists of a canalicular network which is formed by the apical membrane of adjacent hepatocytes and sealed by tight junctions. The bile canaliculi (∼1 μm in diameter) conduct the flow of bile countercurrent to the direction of portal blood flow and connect with the canal of Hering and bile ducts which progressively increase in diameter and complexity prior to the entry of bile into the gallbladder, common bile duct, and intestine. Canalicular bile secretion is determined by both bile salt-dependent and independent transport systems which are localized at the apical membrane of the hepatocyte and largely consist of a series of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transport proteins that function as export pumps for bile salts and other organic solutes. These transporters create osmotic gradients within the bile canalicular lumen that provide the driving force for movement of fluid into the lumen via aquaporins. Species vary with respect to the relative amounts of bile salt-dependent and independent canalicular flow and cholangiocyte secretion which is highly regulated by hormones, second messengers, and signal transduction pathways. Most determinants of bile secretion are now characterized at the molecular level in animal models and in man. Genetic mutations serve to illuminate many of their functions.","title":"Bile formation and secretion.","doi":"10.1002/cphy.c120027"}}

The appearance of hepatobiliary carcinomas in patients with classic PSC and in patients with pericholangitis supports previous evidence indicating that cholangiographically diagnosed large-duct PSC and histologically diagnosed small-duct PSC (pericholangitis) are manifestations of a shared condition that could be named PSC syndrome.

Bile acid uptake was determined radiochemically. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured enzymatically. AE2 was knocked down by lentiviral short hairpin RNA. A cholangiocyte glycocalyx was identified by electron microscopy, was enzymatically desialylated, and sialylation was quantified by flow cytometry. We found that bile acid uptake and toxicity in human immortalized cholangiocytes and cholangiocarcinoma cell lines in vitro were pH and AE2 dependent, with the highest rates at low pH and when AE2 expression was defective. An apical glycocalyx was identified on cholangiocytes in vitro by electron microscopic techniques. Desialylation of this protective layer increased cholangiocellular vulnerability in a pH-dependent manner. A biliary HCO3- umbrella protects human cholangiocytes against damage by bile acid monomers. An intact glycocalyx and adequate AE2 expression are crucial in this process. Defects of the biliary HCO3- umbrella may lead to the development of chronic cholangiopathies.","title":"A biliary HCO3- umbrella constitutes a protective mechanism against bile acid-induced injury in human cholangiocytes.","doi":"10.1002/hep.24691"}}

Lewis and Wistar rats developed weight loss, hepatomegaly, and hepatic inflammation 4 and 12 wk, respectively, after creation of SFBL. Plasma aspartate aminotransferase levels in Lewis rats 4 wk (578 +/- 77 U/L) and Wistar rats 12 wk (220 +/- 35 U/L) after self-filling blind loops were significantly greater than in rats with self-emptying blind loops (112 +/- 24 U/L, p less than 0.001; 104 +/- 22, p less than 0.05) or sham-operated Lewis (84 +/- 24, p less than 0.001) or Wistar (78 +/- 10, p less than 0.001) rats. Randomized comparison using a histology grading score showed abnormalities that paralleled aminotransferase values. Lewis and Wistar rats with self-filling blind loops had hepatic injury with bile duct proliferation, fibrosis and acute and chronic periportal and focal parenchymal inflammation. Lewis and Wistar rats with self-emptying blind loops developed occasional mild histologic lesions. 50% of Lewis rats with self-filling blind loops for 4 wk died compared with only 15% in other groups. However, Buffalo rats with self-filling blind loops developed no weight loss, hepatomegaly, or hepatic injury. Anaerobic cultures of blood, peritoneum and liver were negative in all strains. Diet-restricted, sham-operated Wistar rats with weights similar to the Wistar rats with self-filling blind loops did not develop histologic abnormalities or elevated aminotransferase levels (76 +/- 31 U/L). These results show that experimental small bowel bacterial overgrowth causes significant hepatic inflammation leading to fibrosis in susceptible rat strains. Caloric deprivation and hepatic bacterial invasion are not etiologically responsible.

Both proteins were confirmed as antigens of p-ANCAs in autoimmune liver disorders by demonstrating reactivity of ANCA-positive sera with recombinant TBB-5 (72-88%) and FtsZ (64-82%) on immunoblots and antigen-specific abrogation of ANCA immunofluorescence when sera had been preabsorbed with tubulin and FtsZ. Using sera from interleukin 10-deficient mice (Il10(-)/(-)), an animal model of inflammatory bowel disease, it was also demonstrated that antibodies against TBB-5 are generated in response to intestinal microorganisms. However, unlike autoimmune liver disorders, human antibodies to FtsZ in the absence of TBB-5 antibodies were also a frequent finding in non-autoimmune liver diseases (up to 95%). Reactivity to TBB-5 without the presence of FtsZ antibodies was found in very few cases (<1%) in autoimmune liver disorders. Thus, p-ANCAs in autoimmune liver diseases are directed against human TBB-5 cross-reacting with the bacterial protein FtsZ, probably reflecting an abnormal immune response to intestinal microorganisms in susceptible, possibly genetically predisposed individuals.","title":"p-ANCAs in autoimmune liver disorders recognise human beta-tubulin isotype 5 and cross-react with microbial protein FtsZ.","doi":"10.1136/gut.2008.157818"}}

Given the strong association between the autoimmune liver diseases primary sclerosing cholangitis and autoimmune hepatitis and inflammatory bowel disease, we investigated the role of MAdCAM-1 in recruiting mucosal lymphocytes to the liver. MAdCAM-1 was strongly expressed on inflamed portal vein/sinusoidal endothelium in autoimmune mediated liver disease. In modified Stamper-Woodruff assays, MAdCAM-1 on hepatic vessels supported adhesion of alpha4beta7+ lymphocytes (i.e., gut-derived T cells) from patients with inflammatory bowel disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis. This adhesion was inhibited by pretreatment with blocking antibodies to MAdCAM-1, alpha4beta7, or the integrin alpha4 chain indicating that MAdCAM-1 in inflamed liver is functionally active. Circulating lymphocytes from patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis showed rolling adhesion on MAdCAM-1 transfectants in a flow-based adhesion assay that could be blocked by anti-MAdCAM-1 or anti-alpha4beta7 mAbs. These findings indicate that, under certain circumstances, vessels in the human liver support adhesion of alpha4beta7+ mucosal lymphocytes via binding to aberrantly expressed MAdCAM-1 on liver endothelium.

The sensitivity (Se) and positive predictive value (PPV) of a PSC diagnosis based on administrative data from 2000 to 2003 were determined through chart review data. Algorithms were developed by considering variables associated with PSC and coding details. A logistic regression model was constructed using covariates associated with PSC.

In the administrative data, the initial Se and PPV were 83.7 and 7.2% respectively. The optimal algorithm included one PSC code and one inflammatory bowel disease code and had Se 56% and PPV 59%. Overall, the algorithms yielded inadequate PPV and Se estimates to identify a cohort of true PSC cases. The predictive model was constructed using six covariates.

A systematic literature search of MEDLINE (1950-2010) and Embase (1980-2010) was conducted to identify studies investigating the incidence of PSC. The incidence of PSC was summarized with an incidence rate (IR) and 95% confidence intervals. The test of heterogeneity was performed with the Q statistic. Secondary variables extracted from the articles included the following: the method of case ascertainment, the country, the time period, the age, the male/female incidence rate ratio (IRR), and the incidence of PSC subtypes (small-duct or large-duct PSC and inflammatory bowel disease). Stratified and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity between studies and to assess effects of study quality. Time trends were used to explore differences in the incidence across time. The search retrieved 1669 potentially eligible citations; 8 studies met the inclusion criteria. According to a random-effects model, the pooled IR was 0.77 (0.45-1.09) per 100,000 person-years. However, significant heterogeneity was observed between studies (P < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses excluding non-population-based studies increased the overall IR to 1.00 (0.82-1.17) and eliminated the heterogeneity between studies (P = 0.08).

We found relevant studies through Medline and Scopus, and we examined whether they were population-based; the way they found cases for inclusion and which diagnostic criteria they used; and whether they used standardization to facilitate comparison with other studies. The 55 identified studies varied greatly in their case-finding methods, and only 14 (25%) of them used a standard population. Reported incidence rates of AIH were around 1 per 100,000 population per year, possibly higher in Scandinavia than in other countries, and a Danish study of the 1994-2012 period found an increasing incidence. A majority of PBC studies found incidence rates of 1-2 per 100,000 population per year and an increasing time trend, but incidence was lower in the Netherlands and New Zealand and higher in North East England. Most studies of PSC found incidence rates around 1 per 100,000 population per year, but there were no incident cases among 100,000 Alaska natives during the period 1984-2000.

During follow-up [3.9 (0.1-7.2) years], colorectal cancer was diagnosed in four patients and biliary carcinoma in two (incidences: 0.76 and 0.38 for 100 patient-years, respectively). Kaplan-Meier transplant-free survival at 4 years was 79%. Main causes of death (n = 10) were cancer (n = 5, including three colorectal cancers and two cholangiocarcinoma) or liver failure (n = 4). Indications for transplantation (n = 25) were end-stage liver disease (n = 16), biliary cancer (known or suspected) (n = 5), recurrent acute cholangitis (n = 3) or pruritus (n = 1). Independent predictive factors of death or transplantation were alkaline phosphatase at least 3 upper limit of normal values, platelets less than or equal to 150000/mm3 and bilirubin at least 23 micromol/l. Observed and predicted survivals were similar. PSC in France shares common features with other series and is almost universally treated with UDCA. Under standard-dose UDCA, PSC remains a rather severe disease. However, the low incidence of cholangiocarcinoma is compatible with a potential chemoprotective effect of UDCA against biliary neoplasia development.","title":"Characteristics and clinical course of primary sclerosing cholangitis in France: a prospective cohort study.","doi":"10.1097/MEG.0b013e328331c2b7"}}

The current American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases practice guidelines for PSC advise on the measurement of specific Ig (sIg)G4 in PSC patients, but interpretation of elevated sIgG4 levels remains unclear. We aimed to provide an algorithm to distinguish IAC from PSC using sIgG analyses. We measured total IgG and IgG subclasses in serum samples of IAC (n = 73) and PSC (n = 310) patients, as well as in serum samples of disease controls (primary biliary cirrhosis; n = 22). sIgG4 levels were elevated above the upper limit of normal (ULN = >1.4 g/L) in 45 PSC patients (15%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 11-19). The highest specificity and positive predictive value (PPV; 100%) for IAC were reached when applying the 4 × ULN (sIgG4 > 5.6 g/L) cutoff with a sensitivity of 42% (95% CI: 31-55). However, in patients with a sIgG4 between 1 × and 2 × ULN (n = 38/45), the PPV of sIgG4 for IAC was only 28%. In this subgroup, the sIgG4/sIgG1 ratio cutoff of 0.24 yielded a sensitivity of 80% (95% CI: 51-95), a specificity of 74% (95% CI: 57-86), a PPV of 55% (95% CI: 33-75), and a negative predictive value of 90% (95% CI: 73-97).

In patients with a sIgG4 >1.4 and <2.8 g/L, incorporating the IgG4/IgG1 ratio with a cutoff at 0.24 in the diagnostic algorithm significantly improved PPV and specificity.

The risk for hepatobiliary malignancy was increased 161 times, for colorectal carcinoma 10 times and for pancreatic carcinoma 14 times, compared with that of the general population. In this national-based study including the largest cohort of PSC patients ever presented, the frequency of cholangiocarcinoma is 13%. The risk of hepatobiliary carcinoma is constant after the first year after PSC diagnosis with an incidence rate of 1.5% per year.

From a previous study of the natural history of PSC, we identified 161 patients with PSC who did not have CCA at study entry. Patients were followed until a diagnosis of CCA was established, liver transplantation was performed, or death occurred. Patients were followed for a median of 11.5 yr (interquartile range 4.0-16.1 yr). Fifty-nine patients (36.6%) died, 50 patients (31.1%) underwent liver transplantation, and 11 patients (6.8%) developed CCA. The rate of CCA developing was approximately 0.6% per year. Compared to the incidence rates of CCA in the general population, the relative risk of CCA in PSC was significantly increased (RR = 1,560; 95%CI = 780, 2,793; p < 0.0001). On univariate analysis, a history of variceal bleeding (p < 0.001), proctocolectomy (p= 0.01), and lack of symptoms (p= 0.02) were significant risk factors for CCA with the Mayo Risk Score being marginally significant (p= 0.051). Multivariate analysis determined only variceal bleeding to be a significant risk factor for CCA (RR 24.2; 95%CI: 3.3-67.1). No association was found between the duration of PSC and the incidence of CCA.

Gallbladder dysplasia and adenocarcinoma were correlated with several clinicopathologic parameters using Fisher exact test and t test, including: (1) sex, (2) age, (3) PSC duration, (4) inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at time of OLT, and (5) concomitant bile duct dysplasia or carcinoma. Lymphoplasmacytic chronic cholecystitis was present in 35 (49%), pyloric metaplasia in 69 (96%), intestinal metaplasia in 36 (50%), dysplasia in 27 (37%; low-grade in 12 and high-grade in 15), and adenocarcinoma in 10 (14%; 2 with lamina propria invasion and 8 with invasion into muscularis or adventitia).

The sensitivity and specificity of a gallbladder lesion of 0.80 cm and the presence of gallbladder neoplasia was 100% (95% confidence interval (CI) 77-100%) and 70% (95% CI 35-93%), respectively. Of the patients, 23 (40%) had an early postoperative complication. The Child-Pugh score was the only predictor of postoperative outcomes in the multivariate model (odds ratio 1.78, 95% CI 1.11-3.12, P=0.02). Cholecystectomy in patients with PSC is associated with a high morbidity. Gallbladder polyps <0.80 cm are unlikely to be malignant and observation of these small polyps should be considered. A higher Child-Pugh score was associated with early postoperative complications.","title":"Likelihood of malignancy in gallbladder polyps and outcomes following cholecystectomy in primary sclerosing cholangitis.","doi":"10.1038/ajg.2011.361"}}

A range of histological abnormalities was present in gall bladders from patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis including a mild to moderate degree of epithelial hyperplasia, pseudogland formation, and mononuclear cell infiltrate of the epithelium; moderate to severe chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate and fibrosis affecting the superficial and deep layers of the gall bladder wall; and minimal smooth muscle hypertrophy. These abnormalities were non-specific and were also present in gall bladders from patients with chronic cholecystitis and primary biliary cirrhosis. Vasculitis and granulomas were not present in the patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Immunohistochemistry showed that the superficial and deep mononuclear cell infiltrate in primary sclerosing cholangitis gall bladders was composed predominantly of lymphocytes, in contrast to chronic cholecystitis where macrophages were found in similar or greater numbers. Moreover, T lymphocytes (activated and resting) were present throughout the lymphocytic infiltrate and were apposed to the base and interdigitated between the biliary epithelial cells in significantly greater numbers than in chronic cholecystitis gall bladders. B lymphocytes were present only in lymphoid follicles. Comparative studies using liver biopsy specimens from three of the primary sclerosing cholangitis patients showed a similar T lymphocyte portal tract infiltrate. We conclude that a number of non-specific chronic inflammatory histological abnormalities were present in primary sclerosing cholangitis gall bladders. Immunohistochemistry found other features that were present in this disease - a predominantly lymphocytic mononuclear cell infiltrate of the superficial and deep layers of the gall bladder wall and the presence of T lymphocytes that infiltrated the biliary epithelial cells. These findings support the hypothesis that aberrant cell mediated immune mechanisms may play a role in the pathogenesis of both the intrahepatic and extrahepatic lesions in primary sclerosing cholangitis.","title":"Histological and immunohistochemical study of the gall bladder lesion in primary sclerosing cholangitis","doi":"10.1136/gut.32.4.424"}}

Asparagine at residue 37, which was associated with PSC, induced a positive charge in pocket P9. Tyrosine, which protected against PSC, induced a negative charge in this pocket. Consistent with the statistical observations, variation at residue 86 also indirectly influenced the electrostatic properties of this pocket.

The relative contribution of these mechanisms to the anticholestatic action of UDCA depends on the type and stage of the cholestatic injury. In early-stage primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, protection of injured cholangiocytes against the toxic effects of bile acids might prevail. Stimulation of impaired hepatocellular secretion by mainly post-transcriptional mechanisms, including stimulation of synthesis, targeting and apical membrane insertion of key transporters, seems to be relevant in more advanced cholestasis. In intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, stimulation of impaired hepatocellular secretion could be crucial for rapid relief of pruritus and improvement of serum liver tests, as it is in some forms of drug-induced cholestasis. In cystic fibrosis, stimulation of cholangiocellular calcium-dependent secretion of chloride and bicarbonate ions could have a major impact.

However, whereas there is increasing evidence linking chronic cholestasis and abnormal bile acid profiles to CCA development and progression, the specific mechanisms by which bile acids may be acting to promote cholangiocarcinogenesis and invasive biliary tumor growth have not been fully established. Recent studies have shown that CBAs, but not free bile acids, stimulate CCA cell growth, and that an imbalance in the ratio of free to CBAs may play an important role in the tumorigenesis of CCA. Also, CBAs are able to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2- and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B (AKT)-signaling pathways through sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) in rodent hepatocytes.

Whether this favors intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma development has been investigated in this study. The E. coli RecA gene promoter was cloned upstream from Luc2 to detect in vitro direct genotoxic ability by activation of SOS genes. This assay demonstrated that bile acids were not able to induce DNA damage. The genotoxic effect of the DNA-damaging agent cisplatin was neither enhanced nor hindered by the hepatotoxic and hepatoprotective glycochenodeoxycholic and glycoursodeoxycholic acids, respectively. In contrast, thioacetamide metabolites, but not thioacetamide itself, induced DNA damage. Thus, thioacetamide was used to induce liver cancer in rats, which resulted in visible tumors after 30 weeks. The effect of bile acid accumulation on initial carcinogenesis phase (8 weeks) was investigated in bile duct ligated (BDL) animals. Serum bile acid measurement and determination of liver-specific healthy and tumor markers revealed that early thioacetamide treatment induced hypercholanemia together with upregulation of the tumor marker Neu in bile ducts, which were enhanced by BDL. Bile acid accumulation was associated with increased expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and downregulation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Bile duct proliferation and apoptosis activation, with inverse pattern (BDL > thioacetamide + BDL >> thioacetamide vs. thioacetamide > thioacetamide + BDL > BDL), were observed. In conclusion, intrahepatic accumulation of bile acids does not induce carcinogenesis directly but facilitates a cocarcinogenic effect due to stimulation of bile duct proliferation, enhanced inflammation, and reduction in FXR-dependent chemoprotection. This study reveals that bile acids foster cocarcinogenic events that impact cholangiocarcinoma.","title":"Cocarcinogenic effects of intrahepatic bile acid accumulation in cholangiocarcinoma development.","doi":"10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-13-0503"}}

Standardized definitions of \"overlap syndromes\" are lacking. The aim of this report by the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (IAIHG) is to evaluate if there are important reasons to classify conditions with overlapping features between autoimmune liver diseases as separate diagnostic entities. Definition of diagnostic criteria for overlap conditions can only be arbitrary. The IAIHG scoring system for diagnosis of AIH has been widely used to diagnose \"overlap syndromes\", but was not intended for such use and has not proven to be an efficient tool for this purpose. Some patients with overlapping features between a cholestatic and hepatitic disorder appear to benefit from treatment with a combination of ursodeoxycholic acid and immunosuppressants, but this strategy is not evidence-based, and it seems unjustified to define new diagnostic groups in this regard. The IAIHG suggests that patients with autoimmune liver disease should be categorized according to the predominating feature(s) as AIH, PBC, and PSC/small duct PSC, respectively, and that those with overlapping features are not considered as being distinct diagnostic entities. The IAIHG scoring system should not be used to establish subgroups of patients. Patients with PBC and PSC with features of AIH should be considered for immunosuppressive treatment.

A positive association was observed between level of ALP at T0 and T1 and the hazard of reaching an endpoint, up to values around 2.5 times upper limit of normal (xULN). A larger decrease in ALP between T0 and T1 decreased the event rate. A range of thresholds (0.5-3×ULN) with about similar C-statistics was found.

Results were also validated by analysis of ELF tests using the ADVIA Centaur XP system and its commercially available reagents. We found that PSC patients stratified by ELF score tertiles exhibited significantly different transplant-free survival in both panels (P < 0.001), with higher scores associated with shorter survival, which was confirmed in the validation panel stratified by ELF test tertiles (P = 0.003).

The biopsy specimens were analyzed by a pathologist blinded to the results of VCTE for the stage of fibrosis, and LSM was associated with the stage of fibrosis and other variables using the Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman correlation tests. The cutoff values of LSM were selected based on the accuracy with which they identified the stage of fibrosis on receiver-operating characteristic analysis. The rates of LSM progression were assessed using a linear mixed model, and the association between LSM values and clinical outcomes were evaluated using Cox regression analysis in 168 patients with PSC treated with ursodeoxycholic acid and followed up from November 2004 to July 2013 (mean follow-up period, 4 years). LSM was independently linked to the stage of fibrosis. Cutoff values for fibrosis stages ≥F1, ≥F2, ≥F3, and F4 were 7.4 kPa, 8.6 kPa, 9.6 kPa, and 14.4 kPa, respectively.

To overcome this shortcoming, there is an urgent need to identify appropriate surrogate endpoints. At present, there are no established surrogate endpoints. This article provides a critical review and describes the results of a consensus process initiated by the International PSC Study Group to delineate appropriate candidate surrogate endpoints at present for clinical trials in this frequently dismal disease. The consensus process resulted in a shortlist of five candidates as surrogate endpoints for measuring disease progression: alkaline phosphatase (ALP); transient elastography (TE); histology; combination of ALP+histology; and bilirubin. Of these, histology, ALP, and TE came out as the most promising. However, the expert panel concluded that no biomarker currently exceeds level 3 validation. Combining multiple endpoints is advisable. At present, there are insufficient data to support level 2 validation for any surrogate endpoint in PSC. Concerted efforts by all stakeholders are highly needed.

Based on the controversy associated with this practice, we herein aimed to report the main features and outcomes of our LTX program in PSC. The primary indication for LTX (quality of life/end-stage liver disease or suspected neoplasia) was retrospectively determined for 222 patients undergoing LTX for PSC or other autoimmune liver diseases (primary biliary cirrhosis/autoimmune hepatitis) with at least 5 years of follow-up. In PSC patients impaired quality of life (43.5%) and end-stage liver disease (38.4%) were the most frequent indications for LTX, whereas suspected neoplasia accounted for 18.1%. The proportion of PSC patients with manifest encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, or ascites declined over time. In patients with suspected neoplasia as the primary indication for LTX (n = 25), neoplasia was confirmed in the explanted liver in 20 patients (80%). Five-year survival rates for PSC patients transplanted between 2001 and 2009 were 91.9% for patients receiving LTX due to impaired quality of life or end-stage liver disease and 83.3% for suspected neoplasia.

In patients with suspected neoplasia before LTX, 5-year survival was acceptable, despite confirmation of neoplasia in 80% of the liver explants.","title":"Indications and Outcomes in Liver Transplantation in Patients With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis in Norway","doi":"10.1097/TXD.0000000000000548"}}

We aimed at assessing the severity of fatigue in LT candidates with PBC and the impact of LT on fatigue. In a prospective, longitudinal study, we used the PBC-40 questionnaire in 49 adult patients with PBC at listing and at 6, 12, and 24 months after LT and in two sex- and age-matched cohorts of community controls and non-transplanted PBC patients. Correlation analysis was used to assess the relationship between liver function and fatigue. ANOVA was used to compare the variation of fatigue score before and after LT. There was no correlation between MELD and fatigue before LT (r(2)=0.01). Overall, the fatigue score after LT was substantially lower than before LT, falling from 40.7 ± 11.4 pre-transplant to 27.7 ± 9.5, 28.7 ± 10.1, 26.2 ± 10.1 (p<0.0001) at 6, 12, and 24 months after LT, respectively. The same improvement of fatigue was observed in both low-MELD (<17) and high-MELD (≥ 17) patients. Improvement in fatigue was also evident in the comparison with a \"non-transplant PBC\" control group (31.1 ± 11.6, p=0.03). However, 44% of the total cohort, and 47% of those with low-MELD, for whom the probability of dying of LT may be higher than that of dying without LT, had moderate to severe fatigue (defined as a fatigue score ≥ 29) at two years after LT. Moreover, fatigue scores at two years were higher in the transplant PBC cohort compared to a cohort of community controls (17.8 ± 5.9, p<0.0001). Liver transplantation is associated with improvement in fatigue in patients with PBC. However, a substantial proportion of patients continue to suffer from significant fatigue after two years. Whether the improvement is enough to justify organ allocation in patients with fatigue alone, without liver failure, is still an open issue. Certainly, in the era of organ shortage, with many patients dying waiting for a graft, this may not represent the optimal use of donated deceased organs.","title":"The effect of liver transplantation on fatigue in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis: a prospective study.","doi":"10.1016/j.jhep.2013.04.017"}}

We aimed at improving diagnostic accuracy of CA19-9 by determining the impact of FUT2/3 genotypes. CA19-9 levels were measured in 433 PSC patients, 41 of whom had biliary malignancy. Genotypes for FUT3 and FUT2 were used to assign patients to one of three groups: A, no FUT3 activity regardless of FUT2 activity; B, both FUT2 and FUT3 activity and C, no FUT2 activity without loss of FUT3 activity. Group-specific cut-off values were determined by Youden s index. The median CA19-9 values of cancer-free patients were significantly different (p<0.001) in Groups A (2.0U/ml), B (17.0U/ml), and C (37.0U/ml). Biliary malignancy patients in Groups B and C had significantly higher CA19-9 values than cancer-free patients (p<0.001). The optimal cut-off, as determined by ROC analysis, for all patients was 88.5U/ml. Optimal cut-off values in Groups A, B, and C were 4.0U/ml, 74.5U/ml, and 106.8U/ml, respectively. Use of these values improved sensitivity of CA19-9 in Groups B and C. Further, use of group-dependent cut-off values with 90% sensitivity resulted in a 42.9% reduction of false positive results. Use of FUT2/3 genotype-dependent cut-off values for CA19-9 improved sensitivity and reduced the number of false positive results.","title":"FUT2 and FUT3 genotype determines CA19-9 cut-off values for detection of cholangiocarcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis","doi":"10.1016/j.jhep.2013.08.005"}}
{"type":"node","id":"330","labels":["Paper"],"properties":{"abstract":"Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic fibroinflammatory syndrome involving the biliary tract, often accompanied by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This syndrome is a prototype disease linking chronic inflammation to carcinogenesis. Indeed, PSC is associated with an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), gallbladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and colorectal cancer. Herein, we review the risk for these malignancies in PSC and discuss rational cancer surveillance strategies for these patients. Where evidence is limited, we suggest a pragmatic approach. In this regard, we recommend interval screening for CCA with noninvasive imaging modalities and serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 determinations annually. These imaging studies also serve to screen for gallbladder cancer and HCC. Screening for colorectal cancer is more firmly established in PSC patients with IBD and includes colonoscopy at the time of PSC diagnosis and, thereafter, at 1-2-year intervals. We also highlight areas where more information is required, such as management of biliary tract dysplasia and cancer chemoprevention in PSC.","title":"Cancer surveillance in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis","doi":"10.1002/hep.24570"}}

We evaluated a follow-up algorithm of brush cytology and positron emission tomography/computed tomography with [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG-PET/CT), measured as maximum standardized uptake values, normalized to the liver background (SUVmax/liver) at 180 min, in PSC patients with dominant bile duct strictures. Brush cytology with high grade dysplasia (HGD) was detected in 12/70 patients (17%), yielding a diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 56%, 89%, 75%, and 88%, respectively. Preemptive liver transplantations due to repeated HGD before manifest CCA were performed in six patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of [(18)F]FDG uptake showed that a SUVmax/liver quotient of 3.3 was able to discriminate between CCA and non-malignant disease with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for CCA of 89%, 92%, 62%, 98%, respectively. A SUVmax/liver >3.3 detected CCA in 8/9 patients whereas a quotient <2.4 excluded CCA. Combining brush cytology and quantitative [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT yielded a sensitivity for HGD and/or CCA of 100% and a specificity of 88%. Early detection of HGD before manifest CCA is feasible with repeated brush cytology and may allow for preemptive liver transplantation. [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT has a high sensitivity for manifest CCA and a negative scan indicates a non-malignant state of the disease. Brush cytology and [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT are complementary in monitoring and managing PSC patients with dominant strictures.","title":"Monitoring dominant strictures in primary sclerosing cholangitis with brush cytology and FDG-PET","doi":"10.1016/j.jhep.2014.07.032"}}

Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-fine needle aspiration (FNA) may contribute to the diagnosis of CCA as the etiology of extrahepatic biliary strictures. Our aim was to study the uselfulness of EUS-FNA in diagnosing CCA as the etiology of biliary strictures. In this meta-analysis, PUBMED and EMBASE databases were examined to find studies published to April 2014 where diagnostic correlation of CCA was available. Studies reporting only \"positive for malignancy\" were included in our analysis. The main outcome measurements were sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio. Six studies were included, covering 196 patients. The overall pooled sensitivity and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of EUS-FNA for diagnosis of CCA were 66% [95% confidence interval (CI) 57-74%] and 0.34 (95% CI 0.26-0.43), respectively. In five studies (146 patients), where a mass lesion was detected during EUS, the pooled sensitivity and LR- of EUS-FNA for diagnosis of CCA were 80% [95% CI 72-87%] and 0.20 (95% CI 0.13-0.28), respectively.

Patients with PSC or suspicion of PSC and a clinical indication for ERCP were enrolled between September 2008 and May 2011. Patients underwent cholangioscopy with sampling from biliary strictures. Clinical data, technical information from the ERCP procedure, and results from sampling by brush cytology and mini-forceps biopsy were collected. Long-term follow-up was conducted. Outcomes included technical success, sampling adequacy, and diagnostic accuracy of cholangioscopy-guided sampling for detection of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA).

To define how B-cell clones are distributed in the body, we sequenced 933,427 B-cell clonal lineages and mapped them to eight different anatomic compartments in six human organ donors. We show that large B-cell clones partition into two broad networks-one spans the blood, bone marrow, spleen and lung, while the other is restricted to tissues within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (jejunum, ileum and colon). Notably, GI tract clones display extensive sharing of sequence variants among different portions of the tract and have higher frequencies of somatic hypermutation, suggesting extensive and serial rounds of clonal expansion and selection. Our findings provide an anatomic atlas of B-cell clonal lineages, their properties and tissue connections. This resource serves as a foundation for studies of tissue-based immunity, including vaccine responses, infections, autoimmunity and cancer.","title":"An atlas of B-cell clonal distribution in the human body","doi":"10.1038/nbt.3942"}}}

Although chemokines were initially appreciated as important mediators of acute inflammation, we now know that this complex system of approximately 50 endogenous chemokine ligands and 20 G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane signaling receptors is also critical for the generation of primary and secondary adaptive cellular and humoral immune responses. Recent studies demonstrate important roles for the chemokine system in the priming of naive T cells, in cell fate decisions such as effector and memory cell differentiation, and in regulatory T cell function. In this review, we focus on recent advances in understanding how the chemokine system orchestrates immune cell migration and positioning at the organismic level in homeostasis, in acute inflammation, and during the generation and regulation of adoptive primary and secondary immune responses in the lymphoid system and peripheral nonlymphoid tissue.","title":"Chemokines and chemokine receptors: positioning cells for host defense and immunity","doi":"10.1146/annurev-immunol-032713-120145"}}}

With the inexorable growth of sequence data volume and CPU core counts, the speed and scalability of read-processing tools becomes ever-more important. The accuracy of shotgun read merging is crucial as well, as errors introduced by incorrect merging percolate through to reduce the quality of downstream analysis. Thus, we designed a new tool to maximize accuracy and minimize processing time, allowing the use of read merging on larger datasets, and in analyses highly sensitive to errors. We present BBMerge, a new merging tool for paired-end shotgun sequence data. We benchmark BBMerge by comparison with eight other widely used merging tools, assessing speed, accuracy and scalability. Evaluations of both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BBMerge produces merged shotgun reads with greater accuracy and at higher speed than any existing merging tool examined. BBMerge also provides the ability to merge non-overlapping shotgun read pairs by using k-mer frequency information to assemble the unsequenced gap between reads, achieving a significantly higher merge rate while maintaining or increasing accuracy.","title":"BBMerge - Accurate paired shotgun read merging via overlap","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0185056"}}}

Here we introduce a novel sub-operational-taxonomic-unit (sOTU) approach, Deblur, that uses error profiles to obtain putative error-free sequences from Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq sequencing platforms. Deblur substantially reduces computational demands relative to similar sOTU methods and does so with similar or better sensitivity and specificity. Using simulations, mock mixtures, and real data sets, we detected closely related bacterial sequences with single nucleotide differences while removing false positives and maintaining stability in detection, suggesting that Deblur is limited only by read length and diversity within the amplicon sequences.

Selected identified proteins were measured in serum from two Norwegian PSC cohorts (n=167 [1992-2006] and n=138 [2008-2012]), inflammatory bowel disease (n=96) and healthy controls (n=100). In the bile derivation panel, the levels of 14 proteins were different between PSC patients and controls (p<0.05); all were confirmed in the validation panel. Twenty-four proteins in the bile derivation panel were significantly (p<0.05) different between PSC patients with mild compared to severe cholangiographic changes (modified Amsterdam criteria); this was replicated for 18 proteins in the validation panel. Interleukin (IL)-8, matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)9/lipocalin (LCN)2-complex, S100A8/9, S100A12 and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH)2 in the bile were associated with both a PSC diagnosis and grade of cholangiographic changes.

Human and murine DCs from gut, liver, or portal lymph nodes and hepatic stellate cells were used to activate CD8 T cells. Imprinting of CCR9 and alpha4beta7 and functional migration responses were determined. Crossover activation protocols assessed plasticity of gut homing.

Imprinting was RA dependent and demonstrated plasticity. Imprinting and plasticity of gut-homing human CD8 T cells requires primary activation or reactivation by gut DCs and is retinoic acid dependent.

Medical treatment does not slow the progression of disease, and many patients need liver transplantation, after which recurrent disease is a risk. The increased incidence of hepatobiliary cancer, which is not related to the underlying severity of biliary fibrosis, is of particular concern. Risk of colorectal cancer is also increased in patients with coexistent inflammatory bowel disease. Mechanistic insights have arisen from studies of secondary sclerosing cholangitis, in which a similar clinical profile is associated with a specific cause, and genomic studies have elucidated potential disease-initiating pathways in the primary form. The close association between inflammatory bowel disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis underscores the need to further understand the role of environmental factors in generation of lymphocytes that are postulated to be retargeted, deleteriously, to the biliary tree.

Studies of PSC are limited due to difficulty in accessing the cholangiocyte, the small percentage of these cells in the liver, instability of in vitro culture systems, and reliance on samples from end-stage disease. Here, we demonstrate that stem cells can be isolated from the bile of PSC patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography earlier in their clinical course and maintained long term in vitro as three-dimensional (3D) organoids that express a biliary genetic phenotype. Additionally, bile-derived organoids (BDOs) can be biobanked and samples obtained longitudinally over the course of the disease. These BDOs express known cholangiocyte markers including gamma glutamyl transferase, cytokeratin 19, epithelial cellular adhesion molecule, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, and anion exchanger 2. RNA sequence analysis identified 39 genes whose expression differed in organoids from PSC patients compared to non-PSC controls, including human leukocyte antigen DM alpha chain and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20), immune-related genes previously described in genome-wide association studies of PSC. Incubation of these BDOs with interleukin 17A or tumor necrosis factor alpha led to an immune-reactive phenotype with a significant increase in secretion of proinflammatory mediators, including CCL20, a T-cell chemoattractant. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that bile can be used as a source of biliary-like cells that can be maintained long term in vitro as 3D organoids; these BDOs retain features of cholangiopathies, including the ability to react to inflammatory stimuli by secreting chemokines and propagating an immune-reactive phenotype reflective of the pathogenesis of these diseases; thus, BDOs represent a platform for the study of the pathogenesis and therapy of cholangiopathies, particularly PSC.","title":"Bile-Derived Organoids From Patients With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis Recapitulate Their Inflammatory Immune Profile","doi":"10.1002/hep.30470"}}}

During immune responses, the egress process can be shut down transiently. When this occurs locally it increases lymphocyte numbers in the responding lymphoid organ; when it occurs systemically it can lead to immunosuppression as a result of the depletion of recirculating lymphocytes. Several mediators of the innate immune system are known to cause shutdown, including interferon alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta) and tumour necrosis factor, but the mechanism has been unclear. Here we show that treatment with the IFN-alpha/beta inducer polyinosine polycytidylic acid (hereafter 'poly(I:C)') inhibited egress by a mechanism that was partly lymphocyte-intrinsic. The transmembrane C-type lectin CD69 was rapidly induced and CD69-/- cells were poorly retained in lymphoid tissues after treatment with poly(I:C) or infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Lymphocyte egress requires sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1P1), and IFN-alpha/beta was found to inhibit lymphocyte responsiveness to S1P. By contrast, CD69-/- cells retained S1P1 function after exposure to IFN-alpha/beta. In coexpression experiments, CD69 inhibited S1P1 chemotactic function and led to downmodulation of S1P1. In a reporter assay, S1P1 crosslinking led to co-crosslinking and activation of a CD69-CD3zeta chimaera. CD69 co-immunoprecipitated with S1P1 but not the related receptor, S1P3. These observations indicate that CD69 forms a complex with and negatively regulates S1P1 and that it functions downstream of IFN-alpha/beta, and possibly other activating stimuli, to promote lymphocyte retention in lymphoid organs.","title":"CD69 acts downstream of interferon-alpha/beta to inhibit S1P1 and lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs","doi":"10.1038/nature04606"}}}

Here, we describe a regulatory mechanism that can be exploited for modulating bile acid synthesis. By dissecting the mechanisms of CYP7A1 transcription, we found that bile acids stimulate the sequential recruitment of the histone deacetylases (HDACs) 7, 3, and 1, and of the corepressor SMRTalpha (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors-alpha) and the nuclear corepressor. Bile acids, but not the farnesoid X receptor-selective agonist GW4064, increase the nuclear concentration of HDAC7, which promotes the assembly of a repressive complex that ultimately represses CYP7A1 transcription. Interestingly, despite its high basal expression level, small heterodimer partner (SHP) is associated with the CYP7A1 promoter only at a later stage of bile acid repression. Gene silencing with small interfering RNA confirms that HDAC7 is the key factor required for the repression of CYP7A1 transcription, whereas knockdown of SHP does not prevent the down-regulation of CYP7A1. Administration of the HDAC inhibitors valproic acid or trichostatin A to genetically hypercholesterolemic mice increases Cyp7a1 messenger RNA and bile acid synthesis and consequently markedly reduces total plasma and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. By using a combination of molecular, cellular, and animal models, our study highlights the importance of HDACs in the feedback regulation of CYP7A1 transcription and identifies these enzymes as potential targets to modulate bile acid synthesis and for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.","title":"Insights in the regulation of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene reveal a target for modulating bile acid synthesis","doi":"10.1002/hep.21819"}}}

IL-17 signaling facilitated production of IL-6, IL-1, and tumor necrosis factor-α by inflammatory cells and increased the expression of transforming growth factor-1, a fibrogenic cytokine. IL-17 directly induced production of collagen type I in hepatic stellate cells by activating the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) signaling pathway.

We studied the effects of CFTR deficiency on Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated responses of the biliary epithelium to endotoxins. Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was used to induce colitis in C57BL/6J-Cftrtm1Unc (Cftr-KO) mice and their wild-type littermates.

Cholangiocytes isolated from wild-type and Cftr-KO mice were challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS); cytokine secretion was quantified. Activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), phosphorylation of TLR4, and activity of Src were determined. HEK-293 that expressed the secreted alkaline phosphatase reporter and human TLR4 were transfected with CFTR complementary DNAs. DSS-induced colitis caused biliary damage and portal inflammation only in Cftr-KO mice. Biliary damage and inflammation were not attenuated by restoring biliary secretion with 24-nor-ursodeoxycholic acid but were significantly reduced by oral neomycin and polymyxin B, indicating a pathogenetic role of gut-derived bacterial products. Cftr-KO cholangiocytes incubated with LPS secreted significantly higher levels of cytokines regulated by TLR4 and NF-κB. LPS-mediated activation of NF-κB was blocked by the TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242.

Patients frequently present with asymptomatic, anicteric cholestasis, but many develop progressive biliary strictures with time, leading to recurrent cholangitis, biliary cirrhosis, and end-stage liver disease. Medical treatment does not slow the progression of disease, and many patients need liver transplantation, after which recurrent disease is a risk. The increased incidence of hepatobiliary cancer, which is not related to the underlying severity of biliary fibrosis, is of particular concern. Risk of colorectal cancer is also increased in patients with coexistent inflammatory bowel disease. Mechanistic insights have arisen from studies of secondary sclerosing cholangitis, in which a similar clinical profile is associated with a specific cause, and genomic studies have elucidated potential disease-initiating pathways in the primary form. The close association between inflammatory bowel disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis underscores the need to further understand the role of environmental factors in generation of lymphocytes that are postulated to be retargeted, deleteriously, to the biliary tree.

Hepatobiliary tissues of PSC and non-PSC patients (n = 8-11 per patient group) were collected at transplantation and were analysed for IL8 and FGF19 mRNA expression and IL8 localization. The effect of IL8 on proliferation of primary human cholangiocytes and expression of pro-fibrotic genes was studied. In PSC patients, median IL8 in ductal bile was 6.6 ng/ml vs. 0.24 ng/ml in controls. Median IL8 in gallbladder bile was 7.6 ng/ml in PSC vs. 2.2 and 0.3 ng/ml in two control groups. IL8 mRNA in PSC gallbladder was increased and bile ducts stained positive for IL8. In vitro, IL8 induced proliferation of primary human cholangiocytes and increased the expression of pro-fibrotic genes. Elevation of IL8 in bile of PSC patients, collected at different stages of disease, indicates an ongoing inflammatory stimulus that drives IL8 production. This challenges the idea that advanced PSC is a burned-out disease, and calls for reconsideration of anti-inflammatory therapy in PSC.","title":"Elevated interleukin-8 in bile of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.","doi":"10.1111/liv.13092"}}}

Using a bead-based array targeting 63 proteins, we profiled a derivation panel of Norwegian endoscopic retrograde cholangiography bile samples (55 PSC, 20 disease controls) and a Finnish validation panel (34 PSC, 10 disease controls). Selected identified proteins were measured in serum from two Norwegian PSC cohorts (n=167 [1992-2006] and n=138 [2008-2012]), inflammatory bowel disease (n=96) and healthy controls (n=100). In the bile derivation panel, the levels of 14 proteins were different between PSC patients and controls (p<0.05); all were confirmed in the validation panel. Twenty-four proteins in the bile derivation panel were significantly (p<0.05) different between PSC patients with mild compared to severe cholangiographic changes (modified Amsterdam criteria); this was replicated for 18 proteins in the validation panel. Interleukin (IL)-8, matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)9/lipocalin (LCN)2-complex, S100A8/9, S100A12 and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH)2 in the bile were associated with both a PSC diagnosis and grade of cholangiographic changes. Stratifying PSC patients according to tertiles of serum IL-8, but not MMP9/LCN2 and S100A12, provided excellent discrimination for transplant-free survival both in the serum derivation and validation cohort. Furthermore, IL-8 was associated with transplant-free survival in multivariable analyses in both serum panels independently of age and disease duration, indicating an independent influence on PSC progression. However, the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF®) test and Mayo risk score proved to be stronger predictors of transplant-free survival.

Here, we demonstrate that stem cells can be isolated from the bile of PSC patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography earlier in their clinical course and maintained long term in vitro as three-dimensional (3D) organoids that express a biliary genetic phenotype. Additionally, bile-derived organoids (BDOs) can be biobanked and samples obtained longitudinally over the course of the disease. These BDOs express known cholangiocyte markers including gamma glutamyl transferase, cytokeratin 19, epithelial cellular adhesion molecule, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, and anion exchanger 2.

Here we introduce a novel sub-operational-taxonomic-unit (sOTU) approach, Deblur, that uses error profiles to obtain putative error-free sequences from Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq sequencing platforms. Deblur substantially reduces computational demands relative to similar sOTU methods and does so with similar or better sensitivity and specificity. Using simulations, mock mixtures, and real data sets, we detected closely related bacterial sequences with single nucleotide differences while removing false positives and maintaining stability in detection, suggesting that Deblur is limited only by read length and diversity within the amplicon sequences.

The bile-secretory unit consists of a canalicular network which is formed by the apical membrane of adjacent hepatocytes and sealed by tight junctions. The bile canaliculi (∼1 μm in diameter) conduct the flow of bile countercurrent to the direction of portal blood flow and connect with the canal of Hering and bile ducts which progressively increase in diameter and complexity prior to the entry of bile into the gallbladder, common bile duct, and intestine. Canalicular bile secretion is determined by both bile salt-dependent and independent transport systems which are localized at the apical membrane of the hepatocyte and largely consist of a series of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transport proteins that function as export pumps for bile salts and other organic solutes. These transporters create osmotic gradients within the bile canalicular lumen that provide the driving force for movement of fluid into the lumen via aquaporins. Species vary with respect to the relative amounts of bile salt-dependent and independent canalicular flow and cholangiocyte secretion which is highly regulated by hormones, second messengers, and signal transduction pathways.

The entire colon was usually affected, and the symptoms of the bowel disease were most often mild or moderate. The age at the onset of the colitis was usually below 20 years in patients with combined ulcerative colitis and hepatobiliary disease. In most patients the hepatobiliary disease gave no symptoms. Biochemical data and the histological findings in the liver biopsies did not distinguish between patients with hepatobiliary disease with and without sclerosing cholangitis. Our follow-up study has so far shown that most patients with sclerosing cholangitis remain asymptomatic for a considerable period of time.","title":"Sclerosing cholangitis in ulcerative colitis.","doi":"10.3109/00365528009181516"}}}

The tumors in seven patients were glandular and, sometimes, cystic and papillary; in the remaining patient a combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma was found. The latter tumor seemed to arise from regenerative nodules in secondary biliary cirrhosis complicating PSC. The presence of carcinoma in situ in areas of fibrous cholangitis, the multicentric origin of the tumor, the presence of tumor-free large-duct PSC or small-duct PSC (pericholangitis) at a distance from the carcinomatous areas, and the documentation, in some cases, of long-standing inflammatory hepatobiliary disease prior to the discovery of the tumors would seem to confirm the clinical impression that carcinomas may develop in pre-existing PSC. The appearance of hepatobiliary carcinomas in patients with classic PSC and in patients with pericholangitis supports previous evidence indicating that cholangiographically diagnosed large-duct PSC and histologically diagnosed small-duct PSC (pericholangitis) are manifestations of a shared condition that could be named PSC syndrome. The findings of the present study indicate that the PSC syndrome predisposes patients for the development of bile duct carcinoma.

The effectiveness of brush cytology, carcinoembryonic antigen, and CA19-9 for the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma was retrospectively studied by review of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Receiver operator curves were used to identify cutoff points for carcinoembryonic antigen and CA19-9. Of 692 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis screened, adequate follow-up was obtained in 333, 44 (13%) of whom had a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma.

Patients with features of colitis were compared to counterparts without colitis who had been matched by age, sex, disease severity and treatment regimen. Seventeen patients (16%) had findings of chronic ulcerative colitis. Twelve of these underwent cholangiography and five (42%) had features of primary sclerosing cholangitis. Patients with and without cholangiographic abnormalities were indistinguishable by clinical, laboratory, immunoserologic, and histologic features. Fibrous obliterative cholangitis was present in only two patients, including one with normal cholangiography. Patients with colitis entered remission less frequently (59 vs. 94%, p less than 0.05), failed treatment more commonly (41 vs. 6%, p less than 0.05) and progressed to cirrhosis more frequently (75 vs. 25%, p less than 0.05) than counterparts without colitis.

We conclude that chronic ulcerative colitis can coexist with severe autoimmune hepatitis in the absence of primary sclerosing cholangitis or hepatitis C infection. Under such circumstances its presence does not adversely influence treatment outcome. Primary sclerosing cholangitis cannot be excluded by routine examinations and its presence is associated with a poor treatment response.

We recently hypothesized that an apical biliary HCO3- umbrella might prevent the protonation of biliary glycine-conjugated bile salts and uncontrolled cell entry of the corresponding bile acids, and that defects in this biliary HCO3- umbrella might predispose to chronic cholangiopathies. Here, we tested in vitro whether human cholangiocyte integrity in the presence of millimolar bile salt monomers is dependent on (1) pH, (2) adequate expression of the key HCO3- exporter, anion exchanger 2 (AE2), and (3) an intact cholangiocyte glycocalyx. To address these questions, human immortalized cholangiocytes and cholangiocarcinoma cells were exposed to chenodeoxycholate and its glycine/taurine conjugates at different pH levels. Bile acid uptake was determined radiochemically. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured enzymatically. AE2 was knocked down by lentiviral short hairpin RNA. A cholangiocyte glycocalyx was identified by electron microscopy, was enzymatically desialylated, and sialylation was quantified by flow cytometry. We found that bile acid uptake and toxicity in human immortalized cholangiocytes and cholangiocarcinoma cell lines in vitro were pH and AE2 dependent, with the highest rates at low pH and when AE2 expression was defective. An apical glycocalyx was identified on cholangiocytes in vitro by electron microscopic techniques. Desialylation of this protective layer increased cholangiocellular vulnerability in a pH-dependent manner. A biliary HCO3- umbrella protects human cholangiocytes against damage by bile acid monomers. An intact glycocalyx and adequate AE2 expression are crucial in this process. Defects of the biliary HCO3- umbrella may lead to the development of chronic cholangiopathies.","title":"A biliary HCO3- umbrella constitutes a protective mechanism against bile acid-induced injury in human cholangiocytes.","doi":"10.1002/hep.24691"}}}

Lewis and Wistar rats developed weight loss, hepatomegaly, and hepatic inflammation 4 and 12 wk, respectively, after creation of SFBL. Plasma aspartate aminotransferase levels in Lewis rats 4 wk (578 +/- 77 U/L) and Wistar rats 12 wk (220 +/- 35 U/L) after self-filling blind loops were significantly greater than in rats with self-emptying blind loops (112 +/- 24 U/L, p less than 0.001; 104 +/- 22, p less than 0.05) or sham-operated Lewis (84 +/- 24, p less than 0.001) or Wistar (78 +/- 10, p less than 0.001) rats. Randomized comparison using a histology grading score showed abnormalities that paralleled aminotransferase values. Lewis and Wistar rats with self-filling blind loops had hepatic injury with bile duct proliferation, fibrosis and acute and chronic periportal and focal parenchymal inflammation. Lewis and Wistar rats with self-emptying blind loops developed occasional mild histologic lesions. 50% of Lewis rats with self-filling blind loops for 4 wk died compared with only 15% in other groups. However, Buffalo rats with self-filling blind loops developed no weight loss, hepatomegaly, or hepatic injury. Anaerobic cultures of blood, peritoneum and liver were negative in all strains. Diet-restricted, sham-operated Wistar rats with weights similar to the Wistar rats with self-filling blind loops did not develop histologic abnormalities or elevated aminotransferase levels (76 +/- 31 U/L). These results show that experimental small bowel bacterial overgrowth causes significant hepatic inflammation leading to fibrosis in susceptible rat strains. Caloric deprivation and hepatic bacterial invasion are not etiologically responsible. We suggest that bacterial cell wall polymers or other bacterial toxins from the blind loop cause hepatic lesions in genetically susceptible hosts.","title":"Hepatic inflammation in rats with experimental small intestinal bacterial overgrowth","doi":"10.1016/0016-5085(90)90833-M"}}}

However, unlike autoimmune liver disorders, human antibodies to FtsZ in the absence of TBB-5 antibodies were also a frequent finding in non-autoimmune liver diseases (up to 95%). Reactivity to TBB-5 without the presence of FtsZ antibodies was found in very few cases (<1%) in autoimmune liver disorders.

MAdCAM-1 was strongly expressed on inflamed portal vein/sinusoidal endothelium in autoimmune mediated liver disease. In modified Stamper-Woodruff assays, MAdCAM-1 on hepatic vessels supported adhesion of alpha4beta7+ lymphocytes (i.e., gut-derived T cells) from patients with inflammatory bowel disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis.

The sensitivity (Se) and positive predictive value (PPV) of a PSC diagnosis based on administrative data from 2000 to 2003 were determined through chart review data. Algorithms were developed by considering variables associated with PSC and coding details. A logistic regression model was constructed using covariates associated with PSC.

In the administrative data, the initial Se and PPV were 83.7 and 7.2% respectively. The optimal algorithm included one PSC code and one inflammatory bowel disease code and had Se 56% and PPV 59%. Overall, the algorithms yielded inadequate PPV and Se estimates to identify a cohort of true PSC cases. The predictive model was constructed using six covariates.

A systematic literature search of MEDLINE (1950-2010) and Embase (1980-2010) was conducted to identify studies investigating the incidence of PSC. The incidence of PSC was summarized with an incidence rate (IR) and 95% confidence intervals. The test of heterogeneity was performed with the Q statistic. Secondary variables extracted from the articles included the following: the method of case ascertainment, the country, the time period, the age, the male/female incidence rate ratio (IRR), and the incidence of PSC subtypes (small-duct or large-duct PSC and inflammatory bowel disease). Stratified and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity between studies and to assess effects of study quality. Time trends were used to explore differences in the incidence across time. The search retrieved 1669 potentially eligible citations; 8 studies met the inclusion criteria. According to a random-effects model, the pooled IR was 0.77 (0.45-1.09) per 100,000 person-years. However, significant heterogeneity was observed between studies (P < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses excluding non-population-based studies increased the overall IR to 1.00 (0.82-1.17) and eliminated the heterogeneity between studies (P = 0.08). The IRR for males versus females was 1.70 (1.34-2.07), and the median age was 41 years (35-47 years). All studies investigating time trends reported an overall increase in the incidence of PSC.

A majority of PBC studies found incidence rates of 1-2 per 100,000 population per year and an increasing time trend, but incidence was lower in the Netherlands and New Zealand and higher in North East England.

The incidence and prevalence of PSC were approximately one third of those previously described for primary biliary cirrhosis in the same population. Our data suggest that the prevalence of PSC in the United States, with its attendant medical burdens, is significantly greater than previously estimated.","title":"Incidence, clinical spectrum, and outcomes of primary sclerosing cholangitis in a United States community.","doi":"10.1016/j.gastro.2003.07.011"}}}

A questionnaire was circulated to physicians in 33 hospitals throughout Spain to ascertain the number and the clinical, biochemical and immunologic characteristics of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis from January 1, 1984 to December 31, 1988. Twenty-three centers, from 12 Spanish regions, covering a population of 19.23 million answered the questionnaire. Forty-three patients (60.5% males) with a mean age of 42.3 years (range 12 to 75 years) were seen during the 5-year period. At presentation, 16% of the cases were asymptomatic. Ulcerative colitis was present in 44.2% of cases, and one patient had Crohn's disease. The overall annual incidence ranged from 0.16 to 0.68 cases/million from 1985 to 1988, and the annual prevalence increased from 0.78 cases/million in 1984 to 2.24 cases/million in 1988.

Patients with PSC aged 18 years or above were identified through a computerized search for diagnostic codes. A total number of 199 incident cases fulfilling Mayo criteria for PSC were identified through retrospective validation of clinical records. Temporal trends in the incidence of PSC were investigated by Poisson regression and expressed as average annual percent change (AAPC) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The point prevalence of PSC on December 31, 2005, was 16.2/100,000 in the total adult population (men, 23.7/100,000; women, 8.9/100,000).

We aimed to obtain population-based prevalence and incidence figures, insight in disease course with regard to survival, liver transplantation (LT), and occurrence of malignancies, as well as risk factors thereof. Four independent hospital databases were searched in 44 hospitals in a large geographically defined area of the Netherlands, comprising 50% of the population. In addition, all PSC patients in the three Dutch liver transplant centers and all inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients in the adherence area of a large district hospital were identified. All medical records were reviewed on-site, verifying diagnosis. Five hundred and ninety PSC patients were identified, resulting in an incidence of 0.5 and a point prevalence of 6.0 per 100,000. Median follow up was 92 months. Estimated median survival from diagnosis until LT or PSC-related death in the entire cohort was 21.3 years, as opposed to 13.2 years in the combined transplant centers cohort (n = 422; P < 0.0001). Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) risk was 10-fold increased, as compared to ulcerative colitis controls, and developed at a much younger age (39 years; range, 26-64), compared to IBD controls (59 years; range, 34-73; P = 0.019). Colonoscopic surveillance was associated with significantly better outcome. This study exemplifies that, for relatively rare diseases, it is paramount to collect observational data from large, population-based cohorts, because incidence and prevalence rates of PSC are markedly lower and survival much longer than previously reported. The selection of a bias-free, population-based cohort showed a significantly longer survival, compared to the tertiary referral cohort.

The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate the pathologic characteristics and distribution of colonic disease in UC-PSC patients and to compare the results with a matched control group of UC patients without PSC. Forty UC-PSC patients and 40 matched UC patients without PSC (controls) were identified from the files of 3 hospitals between the years 1989 and 2005. Clinical, endoscopic, and follow-up data (including incidence of pouchitis) were evaluated, and a detailed pathologic evaluation of biopsy and resection specimens (when available) was performed in a blinded fashion. The degree of activity and chronicity in mucosal biopsies and/or tissue from resection specimens was graded on a 5-point grading system (0 to 4), and each portion of the colon (cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, rectum) was assessed separately. Rectal sparing and patchiness of disease were evaluated, and scored as either absolute or relative depending on the complete absence of inflammatory disease in the former, or less inflammatory disease in the rectum compared with other parts of the colon in the latter. In this matched case-control study, UC-PSC patients presented at a significantly earlier age (24.5 y), had a higher prevalence rate of pancolitis (85%), and an overall significantly lower grade of inflammation in the colon (mean grade: 2.09+/-0.085) compared with UC controls (mean age: 33.8 y, pancolitis: 45%, inflammation grade: 2.59+/-0.92, P<0.05 for all comparisons). The incidence rate of absolute and relative rectal sparing (27.5%) and of patchy inflammatory disease proximal to the rectum (5.7%) was not significantly different between the UC-PSC cases and the UC controls (25% and 7.9%, respectively). UC-PSC patients had a higher prevalence rate of ileitis (35.7%) and pouchitis (42.8%), but the values were not significantly different from controls (26.9% and 26.6%, respectively). The incidence rate of dysplasia was similar between the 2 patient groups.

Furthermore, limited information exists on risk factors for the development of CCA in PSC. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of CCA in patients with PSC and to evaluate baseline risk factors for the later development of CCA. From a previous study of the natural history of PSC, we identified 161 patients with PSC who did not have CCA at study entry. Patients were followed until a diagnosis of CCA was established, liver transplantation was performed, or death occurred. Patients were followed for a median of 11.5 yr (interquartile range 4.0-16.1 yr). Fifty-nine patients (36.6%) died, 50 patients (31.1%) underwent liver transplantation, and 11 patients (6.8%) developed CCA. The rate of CCA developing was approximately 0.6% per year. Compared to the incidence rates of CCA in the general population, the relative risk of CCA in PSC was significantly increased (RR = 1,560; 95%CI = 780, 2,793; p < 0.0001). On univariate analysis, a history of variceal bleeding (p < 0.001), proctocolectomy (p= 0.01), and lack of symptoms (p= 0.02) were significant risk factors for CCA with the Mayo Risk Score being marginally significant (p= 0.051). Multivariate analysis determined only variceal bleeding to be a significant risk factor for CCA (RR 24.2; 95%CI: 3.3-67.1). No association was found between the duration of PSC and the incidence of CCA. In conclusion, approximately 7% of PSC patients later developed CCA over a mean follow-up of 11.5 yr, which is dramatically higher than the rates in the general population. Variceal bleeding is a major risk factor for the later development of CCA.","title":"Incidence and risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma in primary sclerosing cholangitis.","doi":"10.1111/j.1572-0241.2004.04067.x"}}}

Thirty-two (26%) had gallstones, 18 (15%) had probable primary sclerosing cholangitis involving the gallbladder, and five (4%) had benign or malignant neoplasms. Our study indicates that gallbladder abnormalities are common among patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, and sonography is the most useful technique for evaluating these conditions.","title":"Gallbladder disease in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.","doi":"10.2214/ajr.150.3.571"}}}

Given the risk of biliary tract cancer in PSC in the face of the benign nature of most gallbladder polyps in the general population, our aim was to determine the prevalence of gallbladder cancer in PSC patients with a gallbladder mass who had undergone cholecystectomy. The case records of all patients with PSC undergoing a cholecystectomy at the Mayo Clinic between 1977-1999 were reviewed. Of the 102 patients with PSC who underwent a cholecystectomy, 14 of 102 (13.7%) had a gallbladder mass. In the subset of patients with gallbladder masses, eight of 14 (57%) had adenocarcinomas (seven primary adenocarcinomas and one metastatic cholangiocarcinoma); the other six had benign masses (five adenomas and one cholesterol polyp). In those patients with benign masses, 33% had associated epithelial cell dysplasia; in patients with primary gallbladder cancers, 57% had associated dysplasia. The patients with primary gallbladder adenocarcinoma had a favorable outcome after cholecystectomy, with a 36-month survival of 66%. In conclusion, gallbladder neoplasms in PSC patients are malignant in approximately 40-60% of the cases. The presence of gallbladder epithelial cell dysplasia suggests a dysplasia-carcinoma sequence in PSC similar to that observed in ulcerative colitis. Consideration should be given to performing a cholecystectomy in PSC patients with gallbladder polyps. If a cholecystectomy is not performed, careful interval follow-up is warranted.","title":"In primary sclerosing cholangitis, gallbladder polyps are frequently malignant.","doi":"10.1111/j.1572-0241.2002.05677.x"}}}

Dysplasia, adenomas, and carcinomas of the gallbladder have been described in PSC but are less common than bile duct carcinomas. However, the prevalence and risk factors for gallbladder neoplasia among patients with PSC undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) have not been well studied. We evaluated 72 gallbladders from 100 consecutive liver explants for PSC, including 66 cholecystectomies performed at the time of OLT and 6 performed before OLT. All specimens were totally embedded for histologic examination. We evaluated the following histologic features: presence of diffuse lymphoplasmacytic chronic cholecystitis, pyloric metaplasia, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia (low-grade or high-grade), and adenocarcinoma. Gallbladder dysplasia and adenocarcinoma were correlated with several clinicopathologic parameters using Fisher exact test and t test, including: (1) sex, (2) age, (3) PSC duration, (4) inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at time of OLT, and (5) concomitant bile duct dysplasia or carcinoma. Lymphoplasmacytic chronic cholecystitis was present in 35 (49%), pyloric metaplasia in 69 (96%), intestinal metaplasia in 36 (50%), dysplasia in 27 (37%; low-grade in 12 and high-grade in 15), and adenocarcinoma in 10 (14%; 2 with lamina propria invasion and 8 with invasion into muscularis or adventitia). Gallbladder carcinoma was associated with intrahepatic bile duct dysplasia (P=0.001), CC (P=0.023), and IBD (P=0.03). Gallbladder dysplasia was associated with hilar/intrahepatic bile duct dysplasia (P=0.0006), CC (P=0.028), IBD (P=0.0014), and older age at OLT (P=0.007). Neither gallbladder carcinoma nor dysplasia had a significant association with sex or PSC duration. These results indicate that complete histologic evaluation of gallbladders in patients undergoing transplantation for PSC yields high frequencies of inflammatory, metaplastic, and neoplastic changes.

Control studies were performed using the gall bladders from six patients (age and sex matched) with chronic cholecystitis and four with primary biliary cirrhosis. A range of histological abnormalities was present in gall bladders from patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis including a mild to moderate degree of epithelial hyperplasia, pseudogland formation, and mononuclear cell infiltrate of the epithelium; moderate to severe chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate and fibrosis affecting the superficial and deep layers of the gall bladder wall; and minimal smooth muscle hypertrophy. These abnormalities were non-specific and were also present in gall bladders from patients with chronic cholecystitis and primary biliary cirrhosis. Vasculitis and granulomas were not present in the patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Immunohistochemistry showed that the superficial and deep mononuclear cell infiltrate in primary sclerosing cholangitis gall bladders was composed predominantly of lymphocytes, in contrast to chronic cholecystitis where macrophages were found in similar or greater numbers. Moreover, T lymphocytes (activated and resting) were present throughout the lymphocytic infiltrate and were apposed to the base and interdigitated between the biliary epithelial cells in significantly greater numbers than in chronic cholecystitis gall bladders. B lymphocytes were present only in lymphoid follicles. Comparative studies using liver biopsy specimens from three of the primary sclerosing cholangitis patients showed a similar T lymphocyte portal tract infiltrate.

Two recent studies reported adenocarcinoma in approximately 60% of the polypoid lesions of the gallbladder in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. One of the adenocarcinomas in the first of these studies, as well as two reported adenocarcinomas in a recent case series, occurred in lesions less than 1 cm. Cholecystectomy is normally not advocated for lesions less than 1 cm, but may be justified in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. In several studies, foci of dysplasia were also detected in separate adenomas and regions of the gallbladder not primarily affected by cancer. Concurrent dysplasia and malignancies of the bile ducts and colon have also been reported, and suggest that an increased awareness of malignancy is warranted in patients once gallbladder neoplasia has been detected. The increased risk of malignancy in primary sclerosing cholangitis also applies to polypoid lesions of the gallbladder. Cholecystectomy and intensified screening for dysplasia of the bile ducts and colon may be advisable in primary sclerosing cholangitis patients with neoplasia of the gallbladder.","title":"Gallbladder polyps in primary sclerosing cholangitis: not so benign.","doi":"10.1097/MOG.0b013e3282f5727a"}}}

Structural modeling showed that rs3749171 is located in the third transmembrane helix of GPR35 and could possibly alter efficiency of signaling through the GPR35 receptor. By refining the analysis of a PSC GWAS by parallel assessments in a UC GWAS, we were able to detect two novel risk loci at genome-wide significance levels. GPR35 shows associations in both UC and PSC, whereas TCF4 represents a PSC risk locus not associated with UC. Both loci may represent previously unexplored aspects of PSC pathogenesis.","title":"Genome-wide association analysis in primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis identifies risk loci at GPR35 and TCF4","doi":"10.1002/hep.25977"}}}

The aim of this study was to analyze the structure and electrostatic properties of the peptide-binding groove of HLA-DR in relation to PSC. Thus, four-digit resolution HLA-DRB1 genotyping was performed in 356 PSC patients and 366 healthy controls. Sequence information was used to assign which amino acids were encoded at all polymorphic positions. In stepwise logistic regressions, variations at residues 37 and 86 were independently associated with PSC (P = 1.2 × 10(-32) and P = 1.8 × 10(-22) in single-residue models, respectively). Three-dimensional modeling was performed to explore the effect of these key residues on the HLA-DR molecule. This analysis indicated that residue 37 was a major determinant of the electrostatic properties of pocket P9 of the peptide-binding groove. Asparagine at residue 37, which was associated with PSC, induced a positive charge in pocket P9. Tyrosine, which protected against PSC, induced a negative charge in this pocket. Consistent with the statistical observations, variation at residue 86 also indirectly influenced the electrostatic properties of this pocket. DRB1*13:01, which was PSC-associated, had a positive P9 pocket and DRB1*13:02, protective against PSC, had a negative P9 pocket.

Thus, liver disease can develop in the absence of a diseased colon and cannot be explained solely by release of toxic factors from the inflamed gut. We propose the existence of an enterohepatic circulation of lymphocytes, whereby some mucosal lymphocytes generated in the gut during active inflammatory disease subsequently persist as longlived memory cells capable of recirculation through the liver. Under the right conditions, these dual-homing lymphocytes might become activated in the liver resulting in hepatic inflammation that is independent from inflammation in the gut. Recent reports that some lymphocyte homing-receptors are shared by the liver and gut provide a molecular basis for this hypothesis and explain the distribution of extraintestinal disease in inflammatory bowel disease.","title":"Homing of mucosal lymphocytes to the liver in the pathogenesis of hepatic complications of inflammatory bowel disease.","doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07374-9"}}}

The recruitment of murine Th17 cells to the liver was studied in vivo using intravital microscopy. IL-17(+) T cells comprised 1-3% of the T cell infiltrate in inflammatory liver diseases and included both CD4+ (Th17) and CD8+ (Tc17) cells.

Binding to human sinusoidal endothelium from flow was dependent on β1 and β2 integrins, CXCR3, and, in the case of Th17 cells, VAP-1. Th17 recruitment via sinusoids in mice with liver inflammation was reduced by treatment with antibodies against CXCR3 ligands, confirming the role of CXCR3 in Th17 recruitment in vivo. In human liver, IL-17(+) cells were detected in portal infiltrates close to inflamed bile ducts expressing the CCR6 ligand CCL20.

We report herein that BEC-mediated T-cell activation occurs partially via programmed death 1 ligands in a cell-contact-dependent manner. Further, such activation occurs via prostaglandin E2 production in a cell-contact-independent fashion. Moreover, the production of prostaglandin E2 was partially controlled by interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha. In conclusion, the regulatory activities of BECs are important for the maintenance of peripheral immune tolerance.

Effects on serum liver tests, liver histology, markers of inflammation and fibrosis, and bile acid transport and metabolism were compared. 24-norUrsodeoxycholic acid metabolism was studied in serum, liver, bile, and urine. 24-norUrsodeoxycholic acid markedly improved liver tests and liver histology and significantly reduced hydroxyproline content and the number of infiltrating neutrophils and proliferating hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. 24-norUrsodeoxycholic acid underwent extensive phase I/II metabolism (hydroxylation, sulfation, and glucuronidation), thereby increasing the hydrophilicity of biliary bile acid secretion. There was a coordinated induction of bile acid detoxifying enzymes (Cyp2b10, Cyp3a11, and Sult2a1) and efflux pumps (Mrp3 and Mrp4). Ursodeoxycholic acid, in contrast, increased alanine transaminase and alkaline phosphatase levels, had no significant effects on hydroxyproline content, and induced biliary transporters and detoxification enzymes to a much smaller extent than 24-norUrsodeoxycholic acid. 24-norUrsodeoxycholic acid ameliorates sclerosing cholangitis in Mdr2(-/-) mice. Its therapeutic mechanisms involve (1) increasing the hydrophilicity of biliary bile acids, (2) stimulating bile flow with flushing of injured bile ducts, and (3) inducing detoxification and elimination routes for bile acids.","title":"24-norUrsodeoxycholic acid is superior to ursodeoxycholic acid in the treatment of sclerosing cholangitis in Mdr2 (Abcb4) knockout mice.","doi":"10.1053/j.gastro.2005.10.018"}}}

PMFs released vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A-containing microparticles, which activated VEGF receptor 2 in ECs and largely mediated their proangiogenic effect. Cholangiocytes potentiated the angiogenic properties of PMFs by increasing VEGFA expression and microparticle shedding in these cells. PMFs are key cells in hepatic vascular remodeling.

However, whereas there is increasing evidence linking chronic cholestasis and abnormal bile acid profiles to CCA development and progression, the specific mechanisms by which bile acids may be acting to promote cholangiocarcinogenesis and invasive biliary tumor growth have not been fully established. Recent studies have shown that CBAs, but not free bile acids, stimulate CCA cell growth, and that an imbalance in the ratio of free to CBAs may play an important role in the tumorigenesis of CCA. Also, CBAs are able to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2- and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B (AKT)-signaling pathways through sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) in rodent hepatocytes.

Our aim was to determine the average cost per correct diagnosis using MRC or ERCP as the initial testing strategy for the diagnosis of PSC. A decision analysis model was constructed employing diagnostic test parameters prospectively determined among 73 patients with clinically suspected biliary disease. ERCP was performed within 24 hours after MRC. Cost data were derived from average Medicare reimbursement fee schedules. The prevalence of PSC in the study cohort was 32%. The sensitivity and specificity of MRC for the diagnosis of PSC were 82% and 98%, respectively. The average cost per correct diagnosis of PSC was 724.00 US dollars for initial MRC (including the cost of ERCP following a negative MRC examination) versus 793.17 US dollars for initial ERCP. In the absence of biliary obstruction, the average cost per correct diagnosis of PSC was 549.64 US dollars with MRC versus 623.25 US dollars or ERCP. The average cost of managing post-ERCP-related complications among patients with PSC was 2902.20 US dollars (range, 1915.40-5031.54 US dollars). For ERCP to be the optimal initial test strategy, a prevalence rate of PSC greater than 45%, MRC specificity less than 85%, or reduction in the average cost per diagnosis to 538.30 US dollars would be required. In conclusion, MRC has comparable accuracy to ERCP and results in cost savings when used as the initial test strategy for diagnosing PSC.","title":"Cost-minimization analysis of MRC versus ERCP for the diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis.","doi":"10.1002/hep.20287"}}}

Main study inclusion criteria were (a) use of ERCP or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) as part of the reference standard for the diagnosis of PSC, (b) inclusion of patients with hepatobiliary disease other than PSC (ie, nonhealthy control subjects), (c) blinding of MRCP image readers to reference-standard results, (d) prospective study with ERCP or MRCP performed after subject recruitment into the study, and (e) inclusion of raw data (for true-positive, false-positive, true-negative, and false-negative results) that could be found or calculated from the original study data. Major exclusion criteria were duplicate article (on a primary study) that contained all or some of the original study data and inclusion of fewer than 10 patients with PSC. Methodologic quality was assessed by using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. Bivariate random-effects meta-analytic methods were used to estimate summary, sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Six manuscripts with 456 subjects (with 623 independent readings)--185 with PSC--met the study inclusion criteria. The summary area under the ROC curve was 0.91. High heterogeneity (inconsistency index, 78%) was found but became moderate (inconsistency index, 36%) with the exclusion of one study in which the diagnostic threshold was set for high sensitivity. There was no evidence of publication bias (P = .27, bias coefficient analysis). Sensitivity and specificity of MRCP for PSC detection across all studies were 0.86 and 0.94, respectively. Positive and negative likelihood ratios with MRCP were 15.3 and 0.15, respectively. In patients with high pretest probabilities, MRCP enabled confirmation of PSC; in patients with low pretest probabilities, MRCP enabled exclusion of PSC. Worst-case-scenario (pretest probability, 50%) posttest probabilities were 94% and 13% for positive and negative MRCP results, respectively. MRCP has high sensitivity and very high specificity for diagnosis of PSC. In many cases of suspected PSC, MRCP is sufficient for diagnosis, and, thus, the risks associated with ERCP can be avoided.","title":"Primary sclerosing cholangitis: meta-analysis of diagnostic performance of MR cholangiopancreatography.","doi":"10.1148/radiol.10091953"}}}

The aim of this report by the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (IAIHG) is to evaluate if there are important reasons to classify conditions with overlapping features between autoimmune liver diseases as separate diagnostic entities. Definition of diagnostic criteria for overlap conditions can only be arbitrary. The IAIHG scoring system for diagnosis of AIH has been widely used to diagnose \"overlap syndromes\", but was not intended for such use and has not proven to be an efficient tool for this purpose. Some patients with overlapping features between a cholestatic and hepatitic disorder appear to benefit from treatment with a combination of ursodeoxycholic acid and immunosuppressants, but this strategy is not evidence-based, and it seems unjustified to define new diagnostic groups in this regard. The IAIHG suggests that patients with autoimmune liver disease should be categorized according to the predominating feature(s) as AIH, PBC, and PSC/small duct PSC, respectively, and that those with overlapping features are not considered as being distinct diagnostic entities. The IAIHG scoring system should not be used to establish subgroups of patients. Patients with PBC and PSC with features of AIH should be considered for immunosuppressive treatment.

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical presentation of PSC including its association with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the development of cholangiocarcinoma at one centre over an observation period of 20 years. All patients with well-defined PSC, diagnosed after 16 years of age and treated at Huddinge University Hospital between 1984 and 2004, were included in the study (n=246). PSC and IBD characteristics were retrieved from the patients  medical records. The patients were subdivided according to the date of diagnosis: 185 PSC patients diagnosed before 30 October 1998 were compared with 61 patients diagnosed after that date. Patients diagnosed after 1998 were significantly older at diagnosis (mean age 41 versus 37 years) and presented fewer symptoms (47% versus 63%) as well as a lower frequency of coexisting IBD (69% versus 82%). In the whole group, women had significantly more symptoms than men, particularly pruritus (p<0.05). The clinical spectrum of PSC in Sweden has changed over the past 20 years; today, PSC patients are older at diagnosis and associated IBD is less frequent.","title":"Changes over a 20-year period in the clinical presentation of primary sclerosing cholangitis in Sweden.","doi":"10.1080/00365520600787994"}}}

METHODS--A total of 305 Swedish patients with PSC were studied. The median follow up time was 63 (1-194) months and all patients could be traced for follow up. Some 79 patients died or had a liver transplant. The prognostic significance of clinical, biochemical, and histological findings at the time of diagnosis were evaluated using multivariate analysis. RESULTS--The estimated median survival from time of diagnosis to death or liver transplantation was 12 years. Cholangiocarcinoma was found in 24 (8%) of the patients and 134 (44%) of the patients were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. The estimated survival rate was significantly higher in the asymptomatic group (p < 0.001). However, 29 (22%) of the asymptomatic patients became symptomatic during the study period. It was found that age, serum bilirubin concentration, and histological stage at the time of diagnosis were independent predictors of a bad prognosis.

The aim of this study was to develop a time-dependent prognostic model for the calculation of updated short-term survival probability in PSC. Consecutive clinical and laboratory follow-up data from the time of diagnosis were collected from the files of 330 PSC patients from 5 European centers, followed for a median of 8.4 years since diagnosis. Time-fixed and time-dependent Cox regression analyses, as well as the additive regression model, were applied. The reliability of the models was tested by a cross-validation procedure. Bilirubin (on a logarithmic scale), albumin, and age at diagnosis of PSC were identified as independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis of both the time-fixed and the time-dependent Cox regression models. The importance of bilirubin was more pronounced in the time-dependent model (hazard ratio [HR], 2.84) than in the time-fixed analysis (hazard ratio, 1.51). The additive regression model indicated that once the patients survive beyond the first 5 years, the impact on prognosis of albumin at diagnosis ceases. The time-dependent prognostic model was superior to the time-fixed variant in assigning low 1-year survival probabilities to patients that actually survived less than 1 year. In conclusion, a time-dependent Cox regression model has the potential to estimate a more precise short-term prognosis in PSC compared with the traditional time-fixed models.","title":"Time-dependent Cox regression model is superior in prediction of prognosis in primary sclerosing cholangitis.","doi":"10.1053/jhep.2002.31872"}}}

We retrospectively collected ALP levels at T0 and T1 for patients included in a large PSC cohort. The association of ALP at T0, T1, and percentage change with the combined endpoint (PSC-related death, liver transplantation) was analysed. Predictive value was determined using C-statistics. A total of 366 patients were included, of whom 66 (18%) reached an endpoint: 26 (7%) PSC-related death, 40 (11%) liver transplantation. At T0 and T1, 84% used ursodeoxycholic acid. A positive association was observed between level of ALP at T0 and T1 and the hazard of reaching an endpoint, up to values around 2.5 times upper limit of normal (xULN). A larger decrease in ALP between T0 and T1 decreased the event rate. A range of thresholds (0.5-3×ULN) with about similar C-statistics was found. In this cohort, the optimal threshold was 1.3×ULN at T1. ALP can be used to discriminate between PSC patients with a good and a poor prognosis. These findings indicate that ALP can serve as stratifier, and potentially as surrogate endpoint for clinical trials in PSC.","title":"Alkaline phosphatase at diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis and 1 year later: evaluation of prognostic value","doi":"10.1111/liv.13110"}}}

The ability to predict survival is important for appropriate management and treatment decisions. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between specific findings on the enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination of the liver and the corresponding magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogram (MRCP) and a survival model for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), the Mayo Risk Score. During a five-year period, 47 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis were identified who had a complete MRI/MRCP examination. The extent of anatomical changes of the biliary tree and the degree of peribiliary enhancement in the hepatic parenchyma were compared with the Mayo Risk Score for each patient. Peribiliary enhancement was present to a varying extent in 38 of 47 cases of PSC. Peribiliary enhancement 3 min after gadolinium administration had a weak correlation with the Mayo Risk Score (analysis of variance P<0.01, Pearson correlation r=0.37). No statistically significant relationship between the severity of extrahepatic or intrahepatic duct changes and the Mayo Risk Score was found (analysis of variance P=0.24, P=0.38, respectively). Although biliary tree changes on MRCP aid in the diagnosis of PSC, they do not correlate with survival, as predicted by the Mayo Risk Score. Peribiliary enhancement on MRI of the liver is a finding occurring to a variable extent in primary sclerosing cholangitis but does not correlate significantly with survival.","title":"Correlation between findings on MRCP and gadolinium-enhanced MR of the liver and a survival model for primary sclerosing cholangitis","doi":"10.1007/s10620-006-9720-1"}}}

At present, there is no appropriate histologic scoring system available for PSC, evaluating both degree of necroinflammatory activity (grade) and fibrosis (stage). The aim of this study was to assess if three scoring systems, commonly used in different liver diseases could be applied for grading and/or staging of PSC. Sixty-four PSC patients from a Dutch cohort, who underwent diagnostic liver biopsy, were included. Staging was scored using Ishak, Nakanuma, and Ludwig systems. Grading was scored using Ishak and Nakanuma systems. Three measures of outcome were defined; transplant-free survival, time to liver transplantation (LTx) and occurrence of cirrhosis related symptoms (CRS). Association of grade and stage with outcome was estimated using Kaplan-Meier log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis. Correlation with biochemistry was assessed by Spearman s rank test. There were strong associations between disease stage measured by Ishak, Nakanuma, and Ludwig staging systems with both outcome measuring transplant-free survival (Hazard ratio (HR) 2.56; 95% CI 1.11-5.89, HR 6.53; 95% CI 2.01-21.22, HR 1.94; 95% CI 1.00-3.79, respectively), and time to LTx (HR 4.18; 95%CI 1.51-11.56, HR 7.05; 95% CI 1.77-28.11, HR 3.13; 95%CI 1.42-6.87, respectively). Ishak and Nakanuma grading systems were not associated with CRS. Weak correlations between histopathology and liver biochemistry were shown. Applying the Nakanuma, Ishak, and Ludwig histopathological staging systems is feasible and clinically relevant given their association with transplant-free survival and time to LTx.

In a prospective, longitudinal study, we used the PBC-40 questionnaire in 49 adult patients with PBC at listing and at 6, 12, and 24 months after LT and in two sex- and age-matched cohorts of community controls and non-transplanted PBC patients. Correlation analysis was used to assess the relationship between liver function and fatigue. ANOVA was used to compare the variation of fatigue score before and after LT. There was no correlation between MELD and fatigue before LT (r(2)=0.01). Overall, the fatigue score after LT was substantially lower than before LT, falling from 40.7 ± 11.4 pre-transplant to 27.7 ± 9.5, 28.7 ± 10.1, 26.2 ± 10.1 (p<0.0001) at 6, 12, and 24 months after LT, respectively.

Improvement in fatigue was also evident in the comparison with a \"non-transplant PBC\" control group (31.1 ± 11.6, p=0.03). However, 44% of the total cohort, and 47% of those with low-MELD, for whom the probability of dying of LT may be higher than that of dying without LT, had moderate to severe fatigue (defined as a fatigue score ≥ 29) at two years after LT. Moreover, fatigue scores at two years were higher in the transplant PBC cohort compared to a cohort of community controls (17.8 ± 5.9, p<0.0001). Liver transplantation is associated with improvement in fatigue in patients with PBC. However, a substantial proportion of patients continue to suffer from significant fatigue after two years. Whether the improvement is enough to justify organ allocation in patients with fatigue alone, without liver failure, is still an open issue. Certainly, in the era of organ shortage, with many patients dying waiting for a graft, this may not represent the optimal use of donated deceased organs.","title":"The effect of liver transplantation on fatigue in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis: a prospective study.","doi":"10.1016/j.jhep.2013.04.017"}}}

After a promising pilot study, we now report our 4 yr experience with short term endoscopic stent therapy for relief of dominant strictures. Between January 1994 and October 1997, 32 patients with symptomatic primary sclerosing cholangitis with a dominant stricture at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography were treated with insertion of a 7- or 10-Fr polyethylene endoprosthesis, which was extracted after a mean of 11 days (range 1-23 days). Primary end points were changes in complaints and cholestasis after 2 months, and time interval until a repeat endoscopic treatment was deemed necessary. A secondary end point was the occurrence of treatment-related complications. Cholestatic complaints improved after 2 months in 83% of patients. Mean scores for pruritus, fatigue, and right upper quadrant pain decreased from 0.94, 1.0, and 0.87 to 0.26, 0.39, and 0.26, respectively. All improvements were significant. Of 14 patients presenting with jaundice, 12 regained normal serum bilirubin levels 2 months after short term endoscopic stenting. The mean levels of conjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase dropped significantly from 36 micromol/L, 309 U/L, and 426 U/L to 7 micromol/L, 205 U/L, and 258 U/L, respectively. The reintervention-free proportions after 1 and 3 yr were 80% and 60%. Seven transient procedure-related complications occurred in 45 therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies. Short term endoscopic stenting for symptomatic dominant strictures in primary sclerosing cholangitis is effective and safe, and the beneficial effect is sustained for several years.","title":"Four years experience with short term stenting in primary sclerosing cholangitis.","doi":"10.1111/j.1572-0241.1999.01364.x"}}}

Liver damage is believed to result from ductal cholestasis, but only 30% of patients with CF develop liver defects, indicating that another factor is involved. We studied the effects of CFTR deficiency on Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated responses of the biliary epithelium to endotoxins. Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was used to induce colitis in C57BL/6J-Cftrtm1Unc (Cftr-KO) mice and their wild-type littermates. Ductular reaction and portal inflammation were quantified by keratin-19 and CD45 immunolabeling. Cholangiocytes isolated from wild-type and Cftr-KO mice were challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS); cytokine secretion was quantified. Activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), phosphorylation of TLR4, and activity of Src were determined. HEK-293 that expressed the secreted alkaline phosphatase reporter and human TLR4 were transfected with CFTR complementary DNAs. DSS-induced colitis caused biliary damage and portal inflammation only in Cftr-KO mice. Biliary damage and inflammation were not attenuated by restoring biliary secretion with 24-nor-ursodeoxycholic acid but were significantly reduced by oral neomycin and polymyxin B, indicating a pathogenetic role of gut-derived bacterial products. Cftr-KO cholangiocytes incubated with LPS secreted significantly higher levels of cytokines regulated by TLR4 and NF-κB. LPS-mediated activation of NF-κB was blocked by the TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242. TLR4 phosphorylation by Src was significantly increased in Cftr-KO cholangiocytes. Expression of wild-type CFTR in the HEK293 cells stimulated with LPS reduced activation of NF-κB. CFTR deficiency alters the innate immunity of the biliary epithelium and reduces its tolerance to endotoxin, resulting in an Src-dependent inflammatory response mediated by TLR4 and NF-κB. These findings might be used to develop therapies for CF-associated cholangiopathy.","title":"Loss of CFTR affects biliary epithelium innate immunity and causes TLR4-NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response in mice.","doi":"10.1053/j.gastro.2011.06.052"}}}

Here, we describe a regulatory mechanism that can be exploited for modulating bile acid synthesis. By dissecting the mechanisms of CYP7A1 transcription, we found that bile acids stimulate the sequential recruitment of the histone deacetylases (HDACs) 7, 3, and 1, and of the corepressor SMRTalpha (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors-alpha) and the nuclear corepressor. Bile acids, but not the farnesoid X receptor-selective agonist GW4064, increase the nuclear concentration of HDAC7, which promotes the assembly of a repressive complex that ultimately represses CYP7A1 transcription. Interestingly, despite its high basal expression level, small heterodimer partner (SHP) is associated with the CYP7A1 promoter only at a later stage of bile acid repression. Gene silencing with small interfering RNA confirms that HDAC7 is the key factor required for the repression of CYP7A1 transcription, whereas knockdown of SHP does not prevent the down-regulation of CYP7A1. Administration of the HDAC inhibitors valproic acid or trichostatin A to genetically hypercholesterolemic mice increases Cyp7a1 messenger RNA and bile acid synthesis and consequently markedly reduces total plasma and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. By using a combination of molecular, cellular, and animal models, our study highlights the importance of HDACs in the feedback regulation of CYP7A1 transcription and identifies these enzymes as potential targets to modulate bile acid synthesis and for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.","title":"Insights in the regulation of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene reveal a target for modulating bile acid synthesis","doi":"10.1002/hep.21819"}}}

We aimed to extensively investigate TGR5 sequence variation in PSC, as well as functionally characterize detected variants. Complete resequencing of TGR5 was performed in 267 PSC patients and 274 healthy controls. Six nonsynonymous mutations were identified in addition to 16 other novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms. To investigate the impact from the nonsynonymous variants on TGR5, we created a receptor model, and introduced mutated TGR5 constructs into human epithelial cell lines. By using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and a cAMP-sensitive luciferase assay, five of the nonsynonymous mutations (W83R, V178M, A217P, S272G and Q296X) were found to reduce or abolish TGR5 function. Fine-mapping of the previously reported PSC and UC associated locus at chromosome 2q35 in large patient panels revealed an overall association between the TGR5 single-nucleotide polymorphism rs11554825 and PSC (odds ratio = 1.14, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-1.26, p = 0.010) and UC (odds ratio = 1.19, 95% confidence interval 1.11-1.27, p = 8.5 x 10(-7)), but strong linkage disequilibrium precluded demarcation of TGR5 from neighboring genes. Resequencing of TGR5 along with functional investigations of novel variants provided unique insight into an important candidate gene for several inflammatory and metabolic conditions. While significant TGR5 associations were detected in both UC and PSC, further studies are needed to conclusively define the role of TGR5 variation in these diseases.","title":"Mutational characterization of the bile acid receptor TGR5 in primary sclerosing cholangitis","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0012403"}}}

Approximately 5% of bile consists of organic and inorganic solutes of considerable complexity. The bile-secretory unit consists of a canalicular network which is formed by the apical membrane of adjacent hepatocytes and sealed by tight junctions. The bile canaliculi (∼1 μm in diameter) conduct the flow of bile countercurrent to the direction of portal blood flow and connect with the canal of Hering and bile ducts which progressively increase in diameter and complexity prior to the entry of bile into the gallbladder, common bile duct, and intestine. Canalicular bile secretion is determined by both bile salt-dependent and independent transport systems which are localized at the apical membrane of the hepatocyte and largely consist of a series of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transport proteins that function as export pumps for bile salts and other organic solutes. These transporters create osmotic gradients within the bile canalicular lumen that provide the driving force for movement of fluid into the lumen via aquaporins. Species vary with respect to the relative amounts of bile salt-dependent and independent canalicular flow and cholangiocyte secretion which is highly regulated by hormones, second messengers, and signal transduction pathways.

We aimed to explore the link between IBD and PSC by studying the intestinal mucosa-adherent microbiota in PSC and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and noninflammatory controls. We included 12 PSC patients, 11 UC patients, and nine noninflammatory controls. The microbiota composition was determined in ileocecal biopsies from each patient by 16S rRNA-based analyses using the human intestinal tract chip. Profiling of the mucosa-adherent microbiota of PSC patients, UC patients, and noninflammatory controls revealed that these groups did not cluster separately based on microbiota composition. At the genus-like level, the relative abundance of uncultured Clostridiales II was significantly lower (almost 2-fold) in PSC (0.26 ± 0.10%) compared with UC (0.41 ± 0.29%) and controls (0.49 ± 0.25%) (p = 0.02). Diversity and richness in the microbiota composition differed across the groups and were significantly lower in PSC patients compared with noninflammatory controls (p = 0.04 and p = 0.02, respectively). No significant differences were found in evenness. Reduced amounts of uncultured Clostridiales II in PSC biopsies in comparison with UC and healthy controls can be considered a signature of a compromised gut, as we have recently observed that this group of as yet uncultured Firmicutes correlates significantly with health.","title":"The mucosa-associated microbiota of PSC patients is characterized by low diversity and low abundance of uncultured Clostridiales II","doi":"10.1093/ecco-jcc/jju023"}}}

The sensitivity (Se) and positive predictive value (PPV) of a PSC diagnosis based on administrative data from 2000 to 2003 were determined through chart review data. Algorithms were developed by considering variables associated with PSC and coding details. A logistic regression model was constructed using covariates associated with PSC.

A systematic literature search of MEDLINE (1950-2010) and Embase (1980-2010) was conducted to identify studies investigating the incidence of PSC. The incidence of PSC was summarized with an incidence rate (IR) and 95% confidence intervals. The test of heterogeneity was performed with the Q statistic. Secondary variables extracted from the articles included the following: the method of case ascertainment, the country, the time period, the age, the male/female incidence rate ratio (IRR), and the incidence of PSC subtypes (small-duct or large-duct PSC and inflammatory bowel disease). Stratified and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity between studies and to assess effects of study quality. Time trends were used to explore differences in the incidence across time. The search retrieved 1669 potentially eligible citations; 8 studies met the inclusion criteria. According to a random-effects model, the pooled IR was 0.77 (0.45-1.09) per 100,000 person-years. However, significant heterogeneity was observed between studies (P < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses excluding non-population-based studies increased the overall IR to 1.00 (0.82-1.17) and eliminated the heterogeneity between studies (P = 0.08). The IRR for males versus females was 1.70 (1.34-2.07), and the median age was 41 years (35-47 years). All studies investigating time trends reported an overall increase in the incidence of PSC. The incidence of PSC is similar in North American and European countries and continues to increase over time. Incidence data from developing countries are lacking, and this limits our understanding of the global incidence of PSC.","title":"Incidence of primary sclerosing cholangitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis","doi":"10.1002/hep.24247"}}}

We found relevant studies through Medline and Scopus, and we examined whether they were population-based; the way they found cases for inclusion and which diagnostic criteria they used; and whether they used standardization to facilitate comparison with other studies. The 55 identified studies varied greatly in their case-finding methods, and only 14 (25%) of them used a standard population. Reported incidence rates of AIH were around 1 per 100,000 population per year, possibly higher in Scandinavia than in other countries, and a Danish study of the 1994-2012 period found an increasing incidence. A majority of PBC studies found incidence rates of 1-2 per 100,000 population per year and an increasing time trend, but incidence was lower in the Netherlands and New Zealand and higher in North East England. Most studies of PSC found incidence rates around 1 per 100,000 population per year, but there were no incident cases among 100,000 Alaska natives during the period 1984-2000. The incidence of IAC remains unknown. The incidence of the autoimmune liver diseases is around 1-2 per 100,000 population per year for each disease. The variation in incidence over time and place suggests that there are differences in the prevalence of risk factors for the diseases, but the studies used different methods and so it is difficult to draw firm conclusions. We recommend that groups of investigators conduct multisite studies with identical case-finding methods, and that they use a standard population to account for differences in demographics.","title":"Worldwide Incidence of Autoimmune Liver Disease","doi":"10.1159/000440705"}}}

Four independent hospital databases were searched in 44 hospitals in a large geographically defined area of the Netherlands, comprising 50% of the population. In addition, all PSC patients in the three Dutch liver transplant centers and all inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients in the adherence area of a large district hospital were identified.

Colonoscopic surveillance was associated with significantly better outcome. This study exemplifies that, for relatively rare diseases, it is paramount to collect observational data from large, population-based cohorts, because incidence and prevalence rates of PSC are markedly lower and survival much longer than previously reported.

The design was a questionnaires-based, multi-center retrospective study. The enrolled subjects were patients with PSC and isolated IgG4-SC diagnosed after 2005. Since the median of age of patients with PSC was 48.1, we defined those who developed the disease at the age older than 48.1 as PSC in the elderly, and the rest as PSC in the young. We defined 98 and 99 patients as PSC in the elderly and in the young, respectively. Although symptoms and biochemistries at presentation were similar, serum IgA and IgM levels were significantly higher and lower in the elderly PSC compared to the young PSC, respectively (P < 0.001, P < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of serum IgG4 levels were 89.5% and 88.9% for discriminating the elderly PSC and IgG4-SC. In terms of complications, prevalence of IBD was 12% in the elderly PSC and 57% in the young PSC, the latter being comparable to those in Europe and the USA. It is reasoned to conclude that PSC in the young resembles those in Europe and the USA in terms of the onset age and prevalence of IBD, while PSC in the elderly is really unique in Japan.","title":"Clinical profiles of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis in the elderly.","doi":"10.1002/jhbp.194"}}}

The current American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases practice guidelines for PSC advise on the measurement of specific Ig (sIg)G4 in PSC patients, but interpretation of elevated sIgG4 levels remains unclear. We aimed to provide an algorithm to distinguish IAC from PSC using sIgG analyses. We measured total IgG and IgG subclasses in serum samples of IAC (n = 73) and PSC (n = 310) patients, as well as in serum samples of disease controls (primary biliary cirrhosis; n = 22). sIgG4 levels were elevated above the upper limit of normal (ULN = >1.4 g/L) in 45 PSC patients (15%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 11-19). The highest specificity and positive predictive value (PPV; 100%) for IAC were reached when applying the 4 × ULN (sIgG4 > 5.6 g/L) cutoff with a sensitivity of 42% (95% CI: 31-55). However, in patients with a sIgG4 between 1 × and 2 × ULN (n = 38/45), the PPV of sIgG4 for IAC was only 28%.

Elevated sIgG4 (>1.4 g/L) occurred in 15% of patients with PSC. In patients with a sIgG4 >1.4 and <2.8 g/L, incorporating the IgG4/IgG1 ratio with a cutoff at 0.24 in the diagnostic algorithm significantly improved PPV and specificity.

From a previous study of the natural history of PSC, we identified 161 patients with PSC who did not have CCA at study entry. Patients were followed until a diagnosis of CCA was established, liver transplantation was performed, or death occurred. Patients were followed for a median of 11.5 yr (interquartile range 4.0-16.1 yr). Fifty-nine patients (36.6%) died, 50 patients (31.1%) underwent liver transplantation, and 11 patients (6.8%) developed CCA. The rate of CCA developing was approximately 0.6% per year. Compared to the incidence rates of CCA in the general population, the relative risk of CCA in PSC was significantly increased (RR = 1,560; 95%CI = 780, 2,793; p < 0.0001). On univariate analysis, a history of variceal bleeding (p < 0.001), proctocolectomy (p= 0.01), and lack of symptoms (p= 0.02) were significant risk factors for CCA with the Mayo Risk Score being marginally significant (p= 0.051). Multivariate analysis determined only variceal bleeding to be a significant risk factor for CCA (RR 24.2; 95%CI: 3.3-67.1). No association was found between the duration of PSC and the incidence of CCA. In conclusion, approximately 7% of PSC patients later developed CCA over a mean follow-up of 11.5 yr, which is dramatically higher than the rates in the general population.

The sensitivity and specificity of a gallbladder lesion of 0.80 cm and the presence of gallbladder neoplasia was 100% (95% confidence interval (CI) 77-100%) and 70% (95% CI 35-93%), respectively.

The Child-Pugh score was the only predictor of postoperative outcomes in the multivariate model (odds ratio 1.78, 95% CI 1.11-3.12, P=0.02). Cholecystectomy in patients with PSC is associated with a high morbidity. Gallbladder polyps <0.80 cm are unlikely to be malignant and observation of these small polyps should be considered.

A range of histological abnormalities was present in gall bladders from patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis including a mild to moderate degree of epithelial hyperplasia, pseudogland formation, and mononuclear cell infiltrate of the epithelium; moderate to severe chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate and fibrosis affecting the superficial and deep layers of the gall bladder wall; and minimal smooth muscle hypertrophy. These abnormalities were non-specific and were also present in gall bladders from patients with chronic cholecystitis and primary biliary cirrhosis. Vasculitis and granulomas were not present in the patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Immunohistochemistry showed that the superficial and deep mononuclear cell infiltrate in primary sclerosing cholangitis gall bladders was composed predominantly of lymphocytes, in contrast to chronic cholecystitis where macrophages were found in similar or greater numbers. Moreover, T lymphocytes (activated and resting) were present throughout the lymphocytic infiltrate and were apposed to the base and interdigitated between the biliary epithelial cells in significantly greater numbers than in chronic cholecystitis gall bladders. B lymphocytes were present only in lymphoid follicles. Comparative studies using liver biopsy specimens from three of the primary sclerosing cholangitis patients showed a similar T lymphocyte portal tract infiltrate.

The frequency of TCRβ nucleotide sequences was significantly higher in PSC samples (2.53 ± 0.80, mean ± standard error of the mean) compared to PBC samples (1.13 ± 0.17, P < 0.0001) and ALD samples (0.62 ± 0.10, P < 0.0001). An average clonotype overlap of 0.85% was detected among PSC samples, significantly higher compared to the average overlap of 0.77% seen within the PBC (P = 0.024) and ALD groups (0.40%, P < 0.0001). From eight to 42 clonotypes were uniquely detected in each of the three disease groups (≥30% of the respective patient samples). Multiple, unique sequences using different variable family genes encoded the same amino acid clonotypes, providing additional support for antigen-driven selection. In PSC and PBC, disease-associated clonotypes were detected among patients with human leukocyte antigen susceptibility alleles. We demonstrate liver-infiltrating disease-associated clonotypes in all three diseases evaluated, and evidence for antigen-driven clonal expansions. Our findings indicate that differential TCR signatures, as determined by high-throughput sequencing, may represent an imprint of distinctive antigenic repertoires present in the different chronic liver diseases; this thereby opens up the prospect of studying disease-relevant T cells in order to better understand and treat liver disease.","title":"High-throughput T-cell receptor sequencing across chronic liver diseases reveals distinct disease-associated repertoires.","doi":"10.1002/hep.28116"}}}

The relative contribution of these mechanisms to the anticholestatic action of UDCA depends on the type and stage of the cholestatic injury. In early-stage primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, protection of injured cholangiocytes against the toxic effects of bile acids might prevail. Stimulation of impaired hepatocellular secretion by mainly post-transcriptional mechanisms, including stimulation of synthesis, targeting and apical membrane insertion of key transporters, seems to be relevant in more advanced cholestasis. In intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, stimulation of impaired hepatocellular secretion could be crucial for rapid relief of pruritus and improvement of serum liver tests, as it is in some forms of drug-induced cholestasis. In cystic fibrosis, stimulation of cholangiocellular calcium-dependent secretion of chloride and bicarbonate ions could have a major impact. Inhibition of bile-acid-induced hepatocyte apoptosis can have a role in all states of cholestasis that are characterized by hepatocellular bile-acid retention. Different mechanisms of action could, therefore, contribute to the beneficial effect of UDCA under various cholestatic conditions.","title":"Drug insight: Mechanisms and sites of action of ursodeoxycholic acid in cholestasis.","doi":"10.1038/ncpgasthep0521"}}}

Normal liver contained rare COL15A1-immunoreactive cells adjacent to the bile ducts and canals of Hering in the portal area. A marked increase in COL15A1 expression occurred together with that of the endothelial marker, von Willebrand factor, in human and rat liver tissue, at advanced stages of fibrosis caused by either biliary or hepatocellular injury. In cirrhotic liver, COL15A1-expressing PMFs adopted a perivascular distribution outlining vascular capillaries proximal to reactive ductules, within large fibrotic septa. The effect of PMFs on endothelial cells (ECs) was evaluated by in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis assays. PMF-conditioned medium increased the migration and tubulogenesis of liver ECs as well as human umbilical vein ECs and triggered angiogenesis within Matrigel plugs in mice. In coculture, PMFs developed intercellular junctions with ECs and enhanced the formation of vascular structures. PMFs released vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A-containing microparticles, which activated VEGF receptor 2 in ECs and largely mediated their proangiogenic effect. Cholangiocytes potentiated the angiogenic properties of PMFs by increasing VEGFA expression and microparticle shedding in these cells. PMFs are key cells in hepatic vascular remodeling. They signal to ECs through VEGFA-laden microparticles and act as mural cells for newly formed vessels, driving scar progression from portal tracts into the parenchyma.","title":"Portal myofibroblasts promote vascular remodeling underlying cirrhosis formation through the release of microparticles.","doi":"10.1002/hep.27318"}}}

Immunohistochemistry showed that the serine/threonine kinase Akt and Mcl-1 are strongly expressed in the preneoplastic bile duct inflammatory disease primary sclerosing cholangitis and in human cholangiocarcinoma specimens. Immunoblotting showed that Akt is expressed and constitutively phosphorylated in 3 human cholangiocarcinoma lines. Further analysis showed that treatment with anti-IL-6-neutralizing antiserum led to reduced Akt phosphorylation, diminished Mcl-1 expression, and enhanced TRAIL sensitivity. Likewise, the Akt inhibitor A443654.3 led to diminished signaling through the Akt pathway, decreased Mcl-1 expression, and enhanced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.

However, whereas there is increasing evidence linking chronic cholestasis and abnormal bile acid profiles to CCA development and progression, the specific mechanisms by which bile acids may be acting to promote cholangiocarcinogenesis and invasive biliary tumor growth have not been fully established. Recent studies have shown that CBAs, but not free bile acids, stimulate CCA cell growth, and that an imbalance in the ratio of free to CBAs may play an important role in the tumorigenesis of CCA. Also, CBAs are able to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2- and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B (AKT)-signaling pathways through sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) in rodent hepatocytes. In the current study, we demonstrate S1PR2 to be highly expressed in rat and human CCA cells, as well as in human CCA tissues.

Serum bile acid measurement and determination of liver-specific healthy and tumor markers revealed that early thioacetamide treatment induced hypercholanemia together with upregulation of the tumor marker Neu in bile ducts, which were enhanced by BDL.

The effectiveness of MRC based on overall cost, however, remains unknown. Our aim was to determine the average cost per correct diagnosis using MRC or ERCP as the initial testing strategy for the diagnosis of PSC. A decision analysis model was constructed employing diagnostic test parameters prospectively determined among 73 patients with clinically suspected biliary disease. ERCP was performed within 24 hours after MRC. Cost data were derived from average Medicare reimbursement fee schedules. The prevalence of PSC in the study cohort was 32%. The sensitivity and specificity of MRC for the diagnosis of PSC were 82% and 98%, respectively. The average cost per correct diagnosis of PSC was 724.00 US dollars for initial MRC (including the cost of ERCP following a negative MRC examination) versus 793.17 US dollars for initial ERCP. In the absence of biliary obstruction, the average cost per correct diagnosis of PSC was 549.64 US dollars with MRC versus 623.25 US dollars or ERCP. The average cost of managing post-ERCP-related complications among patients with PSC was 2902.20 US dollars (range, 1915.40-5031.54 US dollars). For ERCP to be the optimal initial test strategy, a prevalence rate of PSC greater than 45%, MRC specificity less than 85%, or reduction in the average cost per diagnosis to 538.30 US dollars would be required. In conclusion, MRC has comparable accuracy to ERCP and results in cost savings when used as the initial test strategy for diagnosing PSC.","title":"Cost-minimization analysis of MRC versus ERCP for the diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis.","doi":"10.1002/hep.20287"}}}

The aim of the present study was to investigate prevalence and temporal trends in the incidence of PSC 1992-2005 in an adult population in Västra Götaland, a region in southern Sweden with a defined population of about 1.5 million. Patients with PSC aged 18 years or above were identified through a computerized search for diagnostic codes. A total number of 199 incident cases fulfilling Mayo criteria for PSC were identified through retrospective validation of clinical records. Temporal trends in the incidence of PSC were investigated by Poisson regression and expressed as average annual percent change (AAPC) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The point prevalence of PSC on December 31, 2005, was 16.2/100,000 in the total adult population (men, 23.7/100,000; women, 8.9/100,000). The annual incidence was 1.22/100,000 in the total adult population (men, 1.78/100,000; women, 0.69/100,000). The overall incidence rate of PSC increased significantly over the investigation period (AAPC 3.06, 95% CI 0.01-6.20). Stratified analysis revealed significantly increasing trends for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated PSC (AAPC 7.01, 95% CI 0.24-14.24) and large duct PSC (AAPC 6.32, 95% CI 0.03-13.02) in women and for PSC without IBD (AAPC 9.69, 95% CI 0.82-19.33) and small duct PSC (AAPC 17.88, 95% CI 0.95-40.25) in men. This is the first study to report a significantly increasing trend in the incidence of PSC. The prevalence of PSC at the end of the study period is the highest reported to date.

METHODS--A total of 305 Swedish patients with PSC were studied. The median follow up time was 63 (1-194) months and all patients could be traced for follow up. Some 79 patients died or had a liver transplant. The prognostic significance of clinical, biochemical, and histological findings at the time of diagnosis were evaluated using multivariate analysis. RESULTS--The estimated median survival from time of diagnosis to death or liver transplantation was 12 years.

The estimated survival rate was significantly higher in the asymptomatic group (p < 0.001). However, 29 (22%) of the asymptomatic patients became symptomatic during the study period. It was found that age, serum bilirubin concentration, and histological stage at the time of diagnosis were independent predictors of a bad prognosis.

Twenty-two patients met diagnostic criteria for PSC in 1976-2000. The age-adjusted (to 2000 U.S. whites) incidence of PSC in men was 1.25 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 0.70 to 2.06) compared with 0.54 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 0.22 to 1.12) in women. The prevalence of PSC in 2000 was 20.9 per 100,000 men (95% CI, 9.5 to 32.4) and only 6.3 per 100,000 women (95% CI, 0.1 to 12.5). Seventy-three percent of cases had inflammatory bowel disease, the majority with ulcerative colitis. Survival among PSC patients was significantly less than expected for the Minnesota white population of similar age and gender (P < 0.001). These data represent the first population-based estimates of the incidence and prevalence of PSC in the United States. The incidence and prevalence of PSC were approximately one third of those previously described for primary biliary cirrhosis in the same population. Our data suggest that the prevalence of PSC in the United States, with its attendant medical burdens, is significantly greater than previously estimated.","title":"Incidence, clinical spectrum, and outcomes of primary sclerosing cholangitis in a United States community.","doi":"10.1016/j.gastro.2003.07.011"}}}

All residents of the Calgary Health Region diagnosed with PSC between 2000 and 2005 were identified by medical records, endoscopic, diagnostic imaging, and pathology databases. Demographic and clinical information were obtained. Incidence rates were determined and risks associated with PSC were reported as rate ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Forty-nine PSC patients were identified for an age- and gender-adjusted annual incidence rate of 0.92 cases per 100,000 person-years. The incidence of small duct PSC was 0.15/100,000. In children the incidence rate was 0.23/100,000 compared with 1.11/100,000 in adults. PSC risk was similar in Crohn's disease (CD; RR 220.0, 95% CI 132.4-343.7) and ulcerative colitis (UC; RR 212.4, 95% CI 116.1-356.5). Autoimmune hepatitis overlap was noted in 10% of cases. MRCP diagnosed large duct PSC in one-third of cases. Delay in diagnosis was common (median 8.4 months). A minority had complications at diagnosis: cholangitis (6.1%), pancreatitis (4.1%), and cirrhosis (4.1%). Pediatric cases and small duct PSC are less common than adult large duct PSC.

In a prospective study, we analyzed percutaneous liver biopsy specimens from 73 consecutive patients with PSC from January 2005 to December 2010. Patients underwent VCTE no more than 6 months after the biopsy specimens were collected. The biopsy specimens were analyzed by a pathologist blinded to the results of VCTE for the stage of fibrosis, and LSM was associated with the stage of fibrosis and other variables using the Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman correlation tests. The cutoff values of LSM were selected based on the accuracy with which they identified the stage of fibrosis on receiver-operating characteristic analysis. The rates of LSM progression were assessed using a linear mixed model, and the association between LSM values and clinical outcomes were evaluated using Cox regression analysis in 168 patients with PSC treated with ursodeoxycholic acid and followed up from November 2004 to July 2013 (mean follow-up period, 4 years). LSM was independently linked to the stage of fibrosis. Cutoff values for fibrosis stages ≥F1, ≥F2, ≥F3, and F4 were 7.4 kPa, 8.6 kPa, 9.6 kPa, and 14.4 kPa, respectively. The adjusted diagnostic accuracy values for severe fibrosis and cirrhosis were 0.83 and 0.88, respectively. The diagnostic performance of LSM was comparable to that of hyaluronic acid measurement but superior to the aspartate aminotransferase/platelet ratio index, FIB-4 score, and Mayo risk score in differentiating patients with significant or severe fibrosis from those without. LSM had a high level of reproducibility between operators for the same measurement site and for the same operator between 2 adjacent sites. LSM increased significantly and exponentially over time.

We performed a retrospective review of 266 patients with PSC to examine whether LS was associated with the primary endpoint of hepatic decompensation (ascites, variceal hemorrhage and hepatic encephalopathy).

We aimed to obtain population-based prevalence and incidence figures, insight in disease course with regard to survival, liver transplantation (LT), and occurrence of malignancies, as well as risk factors thereof. Four independent hospital databases were searched in 44 hospitals in a large geographically defined area of the Netherlands, comprising 50% of the population. In addition, all PSC patients in the three Dutch liver transplant centers and all inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients in the adherence area of a large district hospital were identified. All medical records were reviewed on-site, verifying diagnosis. Five hundred and ninety PSC patients were identified, resulting in an incidence of 0.5 and a point prevalence of 6.0 per 100,000. Median follow up was 92 months. Estimated median survival from diagnosis until LT or PSC-related death in the entire cohort was 21.3 years, as opposed to 13.2 years in the combined transplant centers cohort (n = 422; P < 0.0001). Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) risk was 10-fold increased, as compared to ulcerative colitis controls, and developed at a much younger age (39 years; range, 26-64), compared to IBD controls (59 years; range, 34-73; P = 0.019). Colonoscopic surveillance was associated with significantly better outcome. This study exemplifies that, for relatively rare diseases, it is paramount to collect observational data from large, population-based cohorts, because incidence and prevalence rates of PSC are markedly lower and survival much longer than previously reported. The selection of a bias-free, population-based cohort showed a significantly longer survival, compared to the tertiary referral cohort.

To overcome this shortcoming, there is an urgent need to identify appropriate surrogate endpoints. At present, there are no established surrogate endpoints. This article provides a critical review and describes the results of a consensus process initiated by the International PSC Study Group to delineate appropriate candidate surrogate endpoints at present for clinical trials in this frequently dismal disease. The consensus process resulted in a shortlist of five candidates as surrogate endpoints for measuring disease progression: alkaline phosphatase (ALP); transient elastography (TE); histology; combination of ALP+histology; and bilirubin. Of these, histology, ALP, and TE came out as the most promising. However, the expert panel concluded that no biomarker currently exceeds level 3 validation. Combining multiple endpoints is advisable. At present, there are insufficient data to support level 2 validation for any surrogate endpoint in PSC. Concerted efforts by all stakeholders are highly needed. Novel, promising noninvasive biomarkers are under study and should be incorporated as exploratory endpoints in clinical trials.","title":"Surrogate endpoints for clinical trials in primary sclerosing cholangitis: Review and results from an International PSC Study Group consensus process.","doi":"10.1002/hep.28256"}}}

In this regard, we recommend interval screening for CCA with noninvasive imaging modalities and serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 determinations annually. These imaging studies also serve to screen for gallbladder cancer and HCC. Screening for colorectal cancer is more firmly established in PSC patients with IBD and includes colonoscopy at the time of PSC diagnosis and, thereafter, at 1-2-year intervals.

The case records of all patients with PSC undergoing a cholecystectomy at the Mayo Clinic between 1977-1999 were reviewed. Of the 102 patients with PSC who underwent a cholecystectomy, 14 of 102 (13.7%) had a gallbladder mass.

However, the prevalence and risk factors for gallbladder neoplasia among patients with PSC undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) have not been well studied.

We evaluated the following histologic features: presence of diffuse lymphoplasmacytic chronic cholecystitis, pyloric metaplasia, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia (low-grade or high-grade), and adenocarcinoma. Gallbladder dysplasia and adenocarcinoma were correlated with several clinicopathologic parameters using Fisher exact test and t test, including: (1) sex, (2) age, (3) PSC duration, (4) inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at time of OLT, and (5) concomitant bile duct dysplasia or carcinoma. Lymphoplasmacytic chronic cholecystitis was present in 35 (49%), pyloric metaplasia in 69 (96%), intestinal metaplasia in 36 (50%), dysplasia in 27 (37%; low-grade in 12 and high-grade in 15), and adenocarcinoma in 10 (14%; 2 with lamina propria invasion and 8 with invasion into muscularis or adventitia).

This study assessed the risk of PSC and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) among first-degree relatives of patients with PSC, compared with the first-degree relatives of a cohort without PSC. Subjects from the national Swedish cohort of PSC patients (n = 678) were matched for date of birth, sex, and region to up to 10 subjects without a diagnosis of PSC (n = 6347). Linkage through general population registers identified first-degree relatives of subjects in both the PSC and comparison cohorts (n = 34,092). Diagnoses among first-degree relatives were identified by using the Inpatient Register. The risk of cholangitis was statistically significantly increased in offspring, siblings, and parents of the PSC patient cohort, compared with relatives of the comparison cohort, with the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals, 11.5 (1.6-84.4), 11.1 (3.3-37.8), and 2.3 (0.9-6.1), respectively. The hazard ratios for ulcerative colitis (UC) among first-degree relatives of all PSC patients was 3.3 (2.3-4.9) and for Crohn s disease 1.4 (0.8-2.5). The risk of UC for relatives of PSC patients without IBD was also increased, 7.4 (2.9-18.9). First-degree relatives of patients with PSC run an increased risk of PSC, indicating the importance of genetic factors in the etiology of PSC. First-degree relatives of PSC patients without IBD are also at an increased risk of UC, which might indicate shared genetic susceptibility factors for PSC and UC.","title":"Increased risk of primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis in first-degree relatives of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.","doi":"10.1016/j.cgh.2008.03.016"}}}

Thus, liver disease can develop in the absence of a diseased colon and cannot be explained solely by release of toxic factors from the inflamed gut. We propose the existence of an enterohepatic circulation of lymphocytes, whereby some mucosal lymphocytes generated in the gut during active inflammatory disease subsequently persist as longlived memory cells capable of recirculation through the liver. Under the right conditions, these dual-homing lymphocytes might become activated in the liver resulting in hepatic inflammation that is independent from inflammation in the gut.

Tissue specificity is lost in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease, when ectopic expression of mucosal addressin cell-adhesion molecule-1 and CCL25 in the liver promotes recruitment of CCR9+alpha4beta7+ T cells to the liver. We investigated the processes that control enterohepatic T-cell migration and whether the ability to imprint CCR9 and alpha4beta7 is restricted to intestinal DCs or can under some circumstances be acquired by hepatic DCs in diseases such as PSC. Human and murine DCs from gut, liver, or portal lymph nodes and hepatic stellate cells were used to activate CD8 T cells. Imprinting of CCR9 and alpha4beta7 and functional migration responses were determined. Crossover activation protocols assessed plasticity of gut homing. Activation by gut DCs imprinted high levels of functional CCR9 and alpha4beta7 on naïve CD8 T cells, whereas hepatic DCs and stellate cells proved inferior. Imprinting was RA dependent and demonstrated plasticity. Imprinting and plasticity of gut-homing human CD8 T cells requires primary activation or reactivation by gut DCs and is retinoic acid dependent. The inability of liver DCs to imprint gut tropism implies that alpha4beta7+CCR9+ T cell that infiltrate the liver in PSC are primed in the gut.","title":"Gut homing receptors on CD8 T cells are retinoic acid dependent and not maintained by liver dendritic or stellate cells","doi":"10.1053/j.gastro.2009.02.046"}}}

We hypothesized that PSC is mediated by long-lived memory T cells originally activated in the gut, but able to mediate extra-intestinal inflammation in the absence of active IBD (Grant, A.J., P.F.

For this purpose, Mdr2(-/-) mice, a model for sclerosing cholangitis, received either a standard diet or a norUDCA-, tauro norursodeoxycholic acid (tauro- norUDCA)-, or di norursodeoxycholic acid (di norUDCA)-enriched diet.

Direct choleretic effects were addressed in isolated bile duct units. The role of Cftr for norUDCA-induced choleresis was explored in Cftr(-/-) mice. norUDCA had pharmacologic features that were not shared by its derivatives, including the increase in hepatic and serum bile acid levels and a strong stimulation of biliary HCO(3)(-)-output. norUDCA directly stimulated fluid secretion in isolated bile duct units in a HCO(3)(-)-dependent fashion to a higher extent than the other bile acids.

The relative resistance of norUDCA to amidation may explain its unique physiologic and pharmacologic properties. These include the ability to undergo cholehepatic shunting and to directly stimulate cholangiocyte secretion, both resulting in a HCO(3)(-)-rich hypercholeresis that protects the liver from cholestatic injury.","title":"Side chain structure determines unique physiologic and therapeutic properties of norursodeoxycholic acid in Mdr2-/- mice","doi":"10.1002/hep.22891"}}}

Patients frequently present with asymptomatic, anicteric cholestasis, but many develop progressive biliary strictures with time, leading to recurrent cholangitis, biliary cirrhosis, and end-stage liver disease. Medical treatment does not slow the progression of disease, and many patients need liver transplantation, after which recurrent disease is a risk. The increased incidence of hepatobiliary cancer, which is not related to the underlying severity of biliary fibrosis, is of particular concern. Risk of colorectal cancer is also increased in patients with coexistent inflammatory bowel disease. Mechanistic insights have arisen from studies of secondary sclerosing cholangitis, in which a similar clinical profile is associated with a specific cause, and genomic studies have elucidated potential disease-initiating pathways in the primary form. The close association between inflammatory bowel disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis underscores the need to further understand the role of environmental factors in generation of lymphocytes that are postulated to be retargeted, deleteriously, to the biliary tree. Treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis is confined to supportive measures, but advances in pathobiology suggest that new stratified approaches will soon be available.","title":"Primary sclerosing cholangitis","doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60096-3"}}}

Immunohistochemically, bIEL were examined in 28 normal livers, 13 cases of chronic viral hepatitis (CVH), 13 cases of PBC, five cases of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), seven cases of extrahepatic biliary obstruction (EBO), and 16 hepatolithiatic livers. In normal livers, bIEL were relatively dense at large and septal bile ducts compared to interlobular ducts. Most of them were positive for CD3 and CD8, while a few were positive for CD4, CD20 and CD57. In CVH, PSC and EBO, neither distribution, phenotype nor density of bIEL differed from normal liver. In hepatolithiasis, numbers of CD8(+)bIEL were increased in stone-containing ducts. In PBC, numbers of CD4(+)CD28(-)bIEL, which are reportedly responsible for target tissue destruction in autoimmune diseases, were markedly increased in damaged interlobular ducts. In conclusion, CD3(+)CD8(+)bIEL may be involved in immune homeostasis of intrahepatic bile ducts in normal livers and in CVH, PSC and EBO. Altered distribution and phenotypes of bIEL in PBC and hepatolithiasis may reflect their participation in biliary lesions. Increased CD4(+)CD28(-)bIEL in damaged bile ducts of PBC may be related to immune-mediated biliary damage.","title":"Characterization of biliary intra-epithelial lymphocytes at different anatomical levels of intrahepatic bile ducts under normal and pathological conditions: numbers of CD4+CD28- intra-epithelial lymphocytes are increased in primary biliary cirrhosis.","doi":"10.1111/j.1440-1827.2006.01913.x"}}}

Thus, liver disease can develop in the absence of a diseased colon and cannot be explained solely by release of toxic factors from the inflamed gut. We propose the existence of an enterohepatic circulation of lymphocytes, whereby some mucosal lymphocytes generated in the gut during active inflammatory disease subsequently persist as longlived memory cells capable of recirculation through the liver. Under the right conditions, these dual-homing lymphocytes might become activated in the liver resulting in hepatic inflammation that is independent from inflammation in the gut. Recent reports that some lymphocyte homing-receptors are shared by the liver and gut provide a molecular basis for this hypothesis and explain the distribution of extraintestinal disease in inflammatory bowel disease.","title":"Homing of mucosal lymphocytes to the liver in the pathogenesis of hepatic complications of inflammatory bowel disease.","doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07374-9"}}}

Given the strong association between the autoimmune liver diseases primary sclerosing cholangitis and autoimmune hepatitis and inflammatory bowel disease, we investigated the role of MAdCAM-1 in recruiting mucosal lymphocytes to the liver. MAdCAM-1 was strongly expressed on inflamed portal vein/sinusoidal endothelium in autoimmune mediated liver disease. In modified Stamper-Woodruff assays, MAdCAM-1 on hepatic vessels supported adhesion of alpha4beta7+ lymphocytes (i.e., gut-derived T cells) from patients with inflammatory bowel disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis. This adhesion was inhibited by pretreatment with blocking antibodies to MAdCAM-1, alpha4beta7, or the integrin alpha4 chain indicating that MAdCAM-1 in inflamed liver is functionally active. Circulating lymphocytes from patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis showed rolling adhesion on MAdCAM-1 transfectants in a flow-based adhesion assay that could be blocked by anti-MAdCAM-1 or anti-alpha4beta7 mAbs. These findings indicate that, under certain circumstances, vessels in the human liver support adhesion of alpha4beta7+ mucosal lymphocytes via binding to aberrantly expressed MAdCAM-1 on liver endothelium. This provides a mechanism to explain the hepatic recruitment of mucosal lymphocytes in inflammatory liver disease complicating inflammatory bowel disease.","title":"MAdCAM-1 expressed in chronic inflammatory liver disease supports mucosal lymphocyte adhesion to hepatic endothelium (MAdCAM-1 in chronic inflammatory liver disease)","doi":"10.1053/jhep.2001.24231"}}}

Gut. 32:1433-1435). However, the liver and bowel inflammation are rarely concomitant, and PSC can develop in patients whose colons have been removed previously. We hypothesized that PSC is mediated by long-lived memory T cells originally activated in the gut, but able to mediate extra-intestinal inflammation in the absence of active IBD (Grant, A.J., P.F. Lalor, M. Salmi, S. Jalkanen, and D.H. Adams. 2002. Lancet. 359:150-157). In support of this, we show that liver-infiltrating lymphocytes in PSC include mucosal T cells recruited to the liver by aberrant expression of the gut-specific chemokine CCL25 that activates alpha4beta7 binding to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 on the hepatic endothelium. This is the first demonstration in humans that T cells activated in the gut can be recruited to an extra-intestinal site of disease and provides a paradigm to explain the pathogenesis of extra-intestinal complications of IBD.","title":"Hepatic endothelial CCL25 mediates the recruitment of CCR9+ gut-homing lymphocytes to the liver in primary sclerosing cholangitis","doi":"10.1084/jem.20041035"}}}

Immunohistochemically, bIEL were examined in 28 normal livers, 13 cases of chronic viral hepatitis (CVH), 13 cases of PBC, five cases of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), seven cases of extrahepatic biliary obstruction (EBO), and 16 hepatolithiatic livers. In normal livers, bIEL were relatively dense at large and septal bile ducts compared to interlobular ducts. Most of them were positive for CD3 and CD8, while a few were positive for CD4, CD20 and CD57. In CVH, PSC and EBO, neither distribution, phenotype nor density of bIEL differed from normal liver. In hepatolithiasis, numbers of CD8(+)bIEL were increased in stone-containing ducts. In PBC, numbers of CD4(+)CD28(-)bIEL, which are reportedly responsible for target tissue destruction in autoimmune diseases, were markedly increased in damaged interlobular ducts. In conclusion, CD3(+)CD8(+)bIEL may be involved in immune homeostasis of intrahepatic bile ducts in normal livers and in CVH, PSC and EBO. Altered distribution and phenotypes of bIEL in PBC and hepatolithiasis may reflect their participation in biliary lesions. Increased CD4(+)CD28(-)bIEL in damaged bile ducts of PBC may be related to immune-mediated biliary damage.","title":"Characterization of biliary intra-epithelial lymphocytes at different anatomical levels of intrahepatic bile ducts under normal and pathological conditions: numbers of CD4+CD28- intra-epithelial lymphocytes are increased in primary biliary cirrhosis.","doi":"10.1111/j.1440-1827.2006.01913.x"}}}

Once entering the liver, lymphocytes localize to bile duct and retain by the combinatorial or sequential action of CXCL12, CXCL16, CX3CL1, and CCL28 and possibly CXCL9 and CXCL10. The relative importance of these chemokines in the recruitment or the retention of lymphocytes around the bile ducts remains unclear. The available data remain limited but underscore the importance of recruitment and homing.","title":"Lymphocyte recruitment and homing to the liver in primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis","doi":"10.1007/s00281-009-0167-2"}},"end":{"id":"225","labels":["Paper"],"properties":{"abstract":"The biliary epithelial cell (BEC) is the target for several human immune mediated liver diseases, including primary biliary cirrhosis, but it is not always clear whether the BEC functions as an accessory cell or an antigen presenting cell, although it is well documented that BECs express high levels of human leukocyte antigen Class II, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3. To examine this issue, we established autoreactive T-cell clones from human leukocyte antigen-DR53 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and characterized BEC function as a function of the ability of BECs to regulate T-cell activation. We report herein that BEC-mediated T-cell activation occurs partially via programmed death 1 ligands in a cell-contact-dependent manner. Further, such activation occurs via prostaglandin E2 production in a cell-contact-independent fashion. Moreover, the production of prostaglandin E2 was partially controlled by interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha. In conclusion, the regulatory activities of BECs are important for the maintenance of peripheral immune tolerance. Further, modulation of BEC function may be used for therapeutic modulation.","title":"Biliary epithelial cells regulate autoreactive T cells: implications for biliary-specific diseases.","doi":"10.1002/hep.20494"}}}
